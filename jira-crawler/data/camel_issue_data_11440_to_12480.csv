At present release no option is given and the host name is always used.


This would mean a change to the logic in org.apache.camel.management.DefaultManagementAgent for determining JMX hostname in 



protected void createMBeanServer()



 method:



if (canAccessSystemProps) {
   try {
      hostName = InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName();
   } catch (UnknownHostException uhe) {
      LOG.info(""Cannot determine localhost name. Using default: "" +
         DEFAULT_REGISTRY_PORT, uhe);
      hostName = DEFAULT_HOST;
   }
} else {
   hostName = DEFAULT_HOST;
}



If the API passed down a request to use the IP then InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostAddress() should be called rather than InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName().


The reason for wanting this is that my host has an underscore _ character in its name.  A java.net.MalformedURLException: Bad URL path: exception is (correctly) thrown by javax.management.remote.JMXServiceURL when the looked up name is used to form the URL for the JMX service.  


I know this is not a valid host name according to the various RFCs, but I have been unable to convince network administrators to change the host name.  If I used the IP instead then validation would pass and the JMX service would be correctly exposed.  


I would find it very helpful if the Camel API could expose an option to use JMX with host IP address as well as for the host name.


I would like to be able to configure something like this:



<jmxAgent id=""camelJmxAgent"" createConnector=""true""
   registryPort=""{{jmx.registry.port:1099}}"" useIpAddress=""true""  />

JdbcCamelCodec is not marshaling all of the exchange properties. 
E.g. it does not marshal exchange's 'CamelFlexAggrStrCollectionGuard' property.
So next time Aggregator tries to fetch BLOB from database, oldExchange does not have above property.
So following code creates new collection for each new object, and hence overwrites the old collection.

* without using tempFileName, each send operation created one server socket on your side (FTP active mode) to send the file to server
* when using tempFileName, each send operation create *three* server sockets
** to check if target file exists
** to check if temp file exists
** to store file

Mina FTP client doesn't provide a way to set SO_REUSEADDR option in server socket, so it defaults to .... platform specific value. In my case (Linux 4.0.6) the value is true, so when creating another server socket, Linux can reuse existing socket in TIME-WAIT state.
Didn't you try considering ftp passive mode?

{{passiveMode=true/false}} does not make any difference in number of connection being opened.
Here test sample is 200 messages with FTP sender. Screen shot shows number of connection reached up till 400( 2 per transaction) 
After removing tempfilename from URI we have a single tcp connection for transaction.

As you mentioned in case of tempfileName there will be 3 active sockets else only 1 will be created. Tempfile configuration should yield just 3 times connection .
These configuration must not change the behavior of SO_REUSEADDR . 
Assume SO_REUSEADDR is set to false in my ftp server it could have created as many number of connections as there were transactions in both scenarios(with / without tempfilename ).
Currently I am figuring out to check SO_REUSEADDR property on my ftp server but I believe it is set to true as same connection is reused when we do not write temp files.

So no problem with reusing TIME-WAIT sockets.

Also I've used my own socket factory to be used in ftp endpoint:
{code:java}
    @Override
    protected JndiRegistry createRegistry() throws Exception {
        JndiRegistry jndi = super.createRegistry();

        SocketFactory sf = new AuditingSocketFactory();
        jndi.bind(""sf"", sf);
        return jndi;
    }
{code}

I used this parameter in FTP endpoint: {{ftpClient.socketFactory=#sf}}. My socket factory just logged information about opening and closing sockets. I had 1000 blocks of such logs:

I am using {{vsftp version 2.2.2 with camel 2.14. }}
Could it be an issue with the ftp server ?

In above comments you have mentioned that even without {{tempfileName}} in URI you are seeing 1000 connection in TIME_WAIT and you have {{disconnect=false}} set in URI. 
With this configuration it should not have opened 1000 connection in TIME_WAIT. That means sockets are not re-used . I am not sure whether my understanding is correct here.

Do you have any other alternative to avoid these many connection ?


ggrzybek:1436250672:2015-07-07T14:31:12.902+0000:1436250672:2015-07-07T14:31:12.902+0000:I checked with camel 2.14.0 as well with the same result. I hade many sockets in TIME-WAIT state.
Please try debugging https://github.com/apache/commons-net/blob/trunk/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/net/ftp/FTPClient.java#L810 - commons-net/ftpclient opens either {{_serverSocketFactory_.createServerSocket}} (active mode) or {{_socketFactory_.createSocket()}} (passive mode), but I didn't have problems with creating socket (reusing them)...

Maybe you have the problem described here: http://ma.juii.net/blog/excessive-ftp-connections ?

Thats a nice article and explains well about ftp active/passive mode. 
My only point here is {{tempFIleName}} configuration in URI should not drive socket behavior as it is happening in my case. It clearly stays that there is a problem in the implementation.

Anyways thanks for your inputs

himanshu:1436252499:2015-07-07T15:01:39.159+0000:1436325187:2015-07-08T11:13:07.525+0000:I will debug FTPClient code and check about the connection creation difference with/without tempFileName configuration.

Still I feel problem that active/passive mode is not resulting in these many connections . Need to check Camel FTP component. As the behavior is driven by tempFIleName configuration

I saw that passive mode doesn't make any difference. And for me not using tempFileName didn't lead to single socket use...

As you mentioned that even {{tempFileName}} does not make any difference in number of connections. Number of Connections shoot up with each file transfer and result in TIME_WAIT connections.
Should not camel-ftp check the connection handling part ? As FTP URI config already has {{disconnect=false}}.

It solved the problem of connection leak at camel end , but still creates a new connection if tempFileName is added as uri paramaters in camel ftp uri. Verified it in 2.19.2 . And same issue

Reiterating the issue
When we have {{tempFilename}} in camel uri and we use producer template to write file to remote ftp location , camel opens new connection for every file transfer. Though {{disconnect}} option is set to false in uri.
If we take out {{tempFilename}} from uri connections are reused.

It works as expected if you specify an absolute path instead:



<cxf-camel:cxfEndpoint id=""greetingService"" address=""http://localhost:8182/cxf/greeting-service"" serviceClass=""org.example.cxf_producer_template.GreetingService""/>




I think that if a relative path is specified, it should be internally translated to the absolute path, in this case http://localhost:8181/cxf/greeting-service.

I think when combining the object name


            Set<ObjectName> set = mBeanServer.queryNames(new ObjectName(agent.getMBeanObjectDomainName() + "":type=services,name=DefaultInflightRepository,*""), null);


The "":context=context-name"" part seems missing.
The query should be something like

""mvn clean install -Dtest=false"" fails the same way. But anyways.. don't need to for this JIRA.

What's confusing is that the context names listed by ""camel:context-list"" don't match what is expected by JMX as the 'context' name.
There is a so-called ""ManagementName"" expected when composing the object name. Not a problem, just one more thing.

When we pass HttpClientParams in EndPoint URI, to override HttpConnectionManager class, the HttpComponent is not considering the overridden parameter, 


Example URL 
https://myapplication.com/myappservice/?bridgeEndpoint=true&throwExceptionOnFailure=false&httpClient.connectionManagerClass=org.apache.commons.httpclient.SimpleHttpConnectionManager 


In org.apache.camel.component.http.HttpComponent, if there is no bean injection of httpConnectionManager class, by default a new instance of MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager class is created. 


In HttpComponent class, while constructing the HttpEndPoint, the same above HttpConnection Manager class is sent as reference. 


In HttpEndPoint class, createHttpClient method, although all the Http client params are considered, HttpConnectionManager class sent by the HttpClient Params is not considered. 


Please clarify or fix it.

You can setup the HttpConnectionManager from the HttpComponent.

See http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/How-to-suppress-exceptions-from-Jsonpath-expressions-td5767384.html


There are 2 options
1.  Make it the default behaviour, so a null value will be returned instead of throwing an PathNotFoundException when evaluating json path expressions and the path is not found. I have a working patch for that here https://github.com/pax95/camel/commit/e09bd00d9199c88787f0acb0d2ea8c86e6a1bba9 that I can do a PR on.


2. Make it configurable on the JsonPath component so you can enable/disable it on demand. This would also make it possible to expose other options from com.jayway.jsonpath.Option if they make sense. More work is require to make it available as both xml and java dsl.


Currently I'm at bit overloaded to do a PR on 2 if that is the preferred option, so if any want to take over It will be fine.


If option 1 is ok I'll create a PR.","davsclaus:1432702076:2015-05-27T12:47:56.868+0000:1432702076:2015-05-27T12:47:56.868+0000:Ideally we should do #2. But your PR for #1 can likely be reused when doing #2 such as unit tests etc. You are welcome to do the PR.

The DSL needs to be updated in camel-core which is just exposed in
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/model/language/JsonPathExpression.java

And then likely a change needed to make fluent builders for Java DSL as well.

 Review comment:
   This comment is 2 years late, but I don't think there's any need to use json-path's internal API?
   
   `Configuration.Builder.build()` will do the same thing internally anyway if no custom `jsonProvider` provided.

 Review comment:
   I wanted to create a PR, but I'm not very sure of the process.
   
   I read that I have to:
   1. Create a JIRA ticket
   2. Commit and reference that ticket ID in the message
   3. Create a PR
   
   Are the steps correct?  And if it is, will that be too much for some refactoring to remove some duplicated lines?

   If its just some cleanup and minor code changes then you do NOT need to create a JIRA ticket. We only use JIRA for normal/bigger things. So in your case, just do the PR

After some debug I found that when my route and with a Choice I cannot weaveAddLast the route. 
When the AdviceWithTasks task method try to add the outputs (here) the implementation of the list return by the ChoiceDefinition class does not implements the method add(int,Object) then we have the UnsupportedOperation 


The difference between 2.14.1 and 2.15.2 is that in the AdviceWithTasks the outputs list where the weaveAddLast try to find the last Processor to add the outputs is not a list returned by ChoiceDefinition but it's a list with the Logs processor. 


This difference is there because now in 2.15.2 the method that is going through the route to retrieve the outputs nodes have a maximum depth which is computed here


When my route have finish with a ChoiceDefinition the maximum depth computed is only 1 then I cannot have my logs in outputs an the weaveAddLast have in his list only the ChoiceDefinition.",davsclaus:1432856637:2015-05-29T07:43:57.983+0000:1432856637:2015-05-29T07:43:57.983+0000:Thanks for reporting.

I made this test:

            <log message=""RECEIVED2, body is '${in.body.getClass.getCanonicalName}'"" loggingLevel=""DEBUG""/>
{code}
and get this output:
{code}
RECEIVED2, body length = '1'
RECEIVED2, body = 'this is the new body'
RECEIVED2, body is 'byte[]'
{code}

Surely this can not be a stream issue? I mean the body is hardcoded here.
I'm using XML instead of java, could that be a problem?

Also, this is using Camel 2.14.0. I'm going to try it with Camel 2.14.2 next.

kafka.serializer.DefaultEncoder - encodes as byte arrays
kafka.serializer.StringEncoder - encodes as Strings



Camel-kafka exposes settings to select the encoder ((serializerClass and keySerializerClass), but the org.apache.camel.component.kafka.KafkaProducer class hard-codes String for both the key and value types.  This results in a ClassCastException when using the DefaultDecoder.


The attached patch fixes this as follows (conforming to kafka itself):



If no serializerClass option is specified, the DefaultDecoder is used.
If no keySerializerClass option is specified, the same encoder as serializerClass is used



This fix shouldn't break any existing code, as there was not previously a default setting (i.e., StringEncoder always had to be specified).

I think this is definitely more of a fix than a new feature.  The camel-kafka component didn't support kafka's {{DefaultEncoder}} prior to this patch.  This would be comparable to the camel-http4 component supporting https (non-default), but not http (default).   

So prior to this patch, the only way to use the component was to specify {{serializerClass=kafka.serializer.StringEncoder}}.  Leaving {{serializerClass}} unspecified would result in an error.  This can be verified by removing the {{serializerClass}} option in {{org.apache.camel.component.kafka.KafkaProducerFullTest}}, then running the test.  

With this patch, leaving {{serializerClass}} unspecified will use the {{DefaultEncoder}}.  Since {{serializerClass}} previously always had to be specified (and specified as {{kafka.serializer.StringEncoder}}) for the component to work, the behavior is unchanged for anyone using the component in their project.  Also note that all of the existing tests still pass with this patch, and I have added new tests for the {{DefaultEncoder}}.

Thanks,
Mark

The error states that there is no output in route.


After some time watching at the code with different breakpoints, I noticed :


In org.apache.camel.scala.dsl.builder.RouteBuilder (l199) the transacted with URI doesn't call the stack.top.transacted with the URI parameter.


Even with this done, it still gives the same error : 


""Route myRoute has no output processors. You need to add outputs to the route such as to(""log:foo"").""


even when  my route is as simple as :


""direct:something"" ==> {
  routeId(""log:foo"")
  transacted(""SomeStrategy"")
  --> (""log:foo"")
}


After some more debug, I saw that the output list for the transacted node stays empty, so my guess is that, in the org.apache.camel.scala.dsl.SAbstractDefinition class, the line def transacted(ref: String) = wrap(target.transacted(ref)) should return something else to handle outputs.

After some playing around and checking the source, the jvm.config are concatenated with MAVEN_OPTS as per the below commit. The problem this causes is, if the same value is in MAVEN_OPTS and jvm.config, java fails.

I'll raise a ticket with maven to see if this can be improved and discard the PR.

I think you just misinterpreted my comment, I said without code formate :)
Any way I managed to apply the patch based on your first PR, it's just add some new parameters (emailAddress,  p12FileName) to use the Calender service. As this is a new feature, I didn't back port the patch into Camel 2.15.x branch.

Now it's time to update [the wiki page|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CAMEL/GoogleCalendar] for it. Please check out the change and make sure I didn't miss anything.

The wiki looks good, thank you.  

On the code formatting, I thought I understood.  I opened it in Eclipse (which I don't normally use) and (re)formatted it using the standard I thought you guys were using.  Is there an xml format file for Camel I should download?

I am wondering if it's an Eclipse cache issue or is there some other code/property file that needs to be updated.

I don't think JBoss Developer Studio supports the camel self document annotation out of box right now :)

carljmosca:1432871705:2015-05-29T11:55:05.045+0000:1432871705:2015-05-29T11:55:05.045+0000:Willem,

I should have been a bit more specific with my question.  While I realize JBDS does not support it right now, it does show the advanced properties after the component is added to the pom file and referenced in the designer.

The issue is it does not include the two newly added properties and the reason I am wondering about Eclipse caching is because we saw the same issue with MuleESB Designer as we updated components there.

Probably more of a question for the designer folks but I would think we could get these two new properties to be recognized along with the original ones more easily/consistently for component writing/modifying in general.

HTH,

You are right, I made a mistake to use the HttpHeaderFilterStrategy directly.
As this HttpHeaderFilter doesn't filter all http related protocol and it also filter the Camel related headers. 
I will commit a quick fix for it by apply a custom HttpHeaderFilterStrategy to use.

It means that camel alway delete the file when it finish the processing the S3 file. If you don't delete the file you may hit another issue CAMEL-8431 which should be addressed in Camel 2.14.3.

From the log message there still a inflight message there, I think it could explain that why the file  /xxx-workspaces/bbb.txt0 is not deleted yet.

BTW, please use email to discuss this kind of issue first, if it's an issue of Camel we can create a JIRA then.

But there can be use cases where you want the EIP to do this sooner, eg when the EIP scope ends.


For example outside the scope of the EIP and if some error happens then the on completion will rollback, and then a redelivery can happen. And if so then the idempotent block may execute again, despite that block was success before.


If users do not want this to happen then we need a new option they can turn on to do the on completion when the eip ends, eg in its callback and not as on completion.

    CAMEL-8758: Fix to Camel Cache producer to avoid NPE in race condition

    Fix to avoid potential race condition which can cause NPE. An element is retrieved from the cache to perform a null check and if not null, retrieved once again to perform object retrieval. If the object is either removed from the cache or TTL expires, can result in NPE.

FTP and FTPS Only: Camel 2.4: Is the SocketOptions.SO_TIMEOUT value in millis. Note SFTP will automatic use the connectTimeout as the soTimeout.


The last statement is unfortunately not entirely true. JSCH's Session.connect(int connectTimeout) method will initially set the SO_TIMEOUT of the underlying socket to connectTimeout, however once the connection phase is finished, it will change this value to the provided timeout value.


We have an incredibly broken SFTP server. On that connections sometimes hang after the connect phase, which causes polling consumer endpoints to hang in a Socket.read() forever (which means that they stop polling).


IMO the fix for that is twofold:
1. I attach a (trivial one-line) fix for the camel-ftp component, which will set the soTimeout parameter to the timeout parameter of the JSCH session.
2. Someone with the access rights should modify the camel-ftp documentation
3. It might make sense to set the default for the soTimeout parameter to something more sane than 0 (forever) but I don't do that in the patch (as it may change the existing behaviour).","siano:1431060469:2015-05-08T12:47:49.518+0000:1431060469:2015-05-08T12:47:49.518+0000:One might discuss whether this is an extension or a bug.

I am not able to edit the documentation. I will check the ICLA signing with my employer (but this may take some time because I have to find out how that process works first).

There are some general questions remaining:
1. Does it make sense to set a general default for the soTimeout (e.g. 300000 (5 minutes))? This would change the behaviour for all endpoints, which is probably not so good (at least not in a patch). On the other hand having an SFTP (or FTP) poller that hangs forever on a stuck socket also doesn't make too much sense for me.
2. I am unsure about what is the best way to change the documentation. A potential approach would be:
a) remove the sentence ""Note SFTP will automatic use the connectTimeout as the soTimeout."" now. It is not really true.
b) once the patch is applied and released change the documentation again, however, I am not sure what would be the best here:
""FTP and FTPS Only: Camel 2.4, SFTP: Camel 2.14.3, 2.15.3: Is the SocketOptions.SO_TIMEOUT value in millis.""?

What do you think?

we encountered a problem when consuming events from Kafka and stopping the route while there are still events in Kafka.
Obviously, the run-method doesn't stop reading events from Kafka stream and so there are always events in-flight what prevents the route from being gracefully shut down.

http://confluent.io/docs/current/schema-registry/docs/serializer-formatter.html
njiang:1431036956:2015-05-08T06:15:56.757+0000:1431036956:2015-05-08T06:15:56.757+0000:OK, the example just shows a way to send messages of Avro type to Kafka.  
As we have camel-avro data format, we can consider sending the more generic message to Kafka by default.

String msg = exchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);

",Resolved,Resolved,2.18.0,Luca Burgazzoli,Geert Schuring,0,5,2015-04-30 12:47:48+00:00,2016-05-03 13:29:15+00:00,"Using Pojo Messaging annotations, Camel automatically uses the Type Converter system to unmarshall XML messages to JAXB objects in the following scenario:



public class CamelPojoDemo {
	
    @Produce(uri = ""amq:camelpojodemo.reply"")
    private ProducerTemplate producer;
	
    @Consume(uri = ""amq:camelpojodemo.request"")
    public void trigger(UpdateMarketDataMessage message) {
    	String result = ""Processed prices: "" + message.getMarketData().getPrices().size();
    	producer.sendBody(result);
    }
}




However, handing the producer a JAXB object and expecting it to marshall it to XML before sending it does not seem possible in the current API.


I would like to propose to add the following method to the ProducerTemplate:




  /**
     * Sends the body to the default endpoint after converting it to the given type
     * <br/><br/>
     * <p/><b>Notice:</b> that if the processing of the exchange failed with an Exception
     * it is thrown from this method as a {@link org.apache.camel.CamelExecutionException} with
     * the caused exception wrapped.
     *
     * @param body the payload to send
     * @param type the type which the body should be converted to before sending
     * @throws CamelExecutionException if the processing of the exchange failed
     */
    void sendBody(Object body, Class type) throws CamelExecutionException;





This would allow users to send a JAXB object and instruct Camel to use its Type Converter system to marshall the object to XML:



producer.sendBody(jaxbObject, String.class);




Note: The sendBody, sendBodyAndHeader and sendBodyAndProperty methods are all overloaded several times which could mean quite a number of new methods.","davsclaus:1430369477:2015-04-30T12:51:17.348+0000:1430369477:2015-04-30T12:51:17.348+0000:I suggest using sendBodyAs as the name then it stands out for the others.

{code}
ProducerTemplateBuider template = ...

template.withBodyAs(body, String.class).addHeader(""foo"", 123).addHeader(""bar"", 456).send();
template.withBodyAs(body, String.class).addHeader(""foo"", 123).addHeader(""bar"", 456).to(""jms:queue:bla"").send();

template.withBodyAs(body, String.class).addHeader(""foo"", 123).addHeader(""bar"", 456).withPattern(ExchangePattern.InOnly).send();
Exchange out = template.withBodyAs(body, String.class).addHeader(""foo"", 123).addHeader(""bar"", 456).request();
Object reply = template.withBodyAs(body, String.class).addHeader(""foo"", 123).addHeader(""bar"", 456).requestBody();
String reply = template.withBodyAs(body, String.class).addHeader(""foo"", 123).addHeader(""bar"", 456).requestBodyAs(String.class);
{code}

And you can get the builder from the existing producer template
{code}
ProducerTemplateBuilder builder = template.builder();
...
{code}

And it would also work with the existing @Produce annotations so you can IoC inject it

{code}
@Produce(uri = ""jms:queue:foo"")
private ProducerTemplateBuilder template;

However I have some comments to the chosen solution.

1. In FtpBadLoginConnectionLeakTest.java using maximumReconnectAttempts=3 (which is camel default), causes leaking sockets, and hence test to fail.

2. In RemoteFileConsumer.java. Some FTP servers (at least one of ours), responds OK to getOperations().sendNoop(), even though user has not been authorized.
This again causes leaking sockets where;
            isConnected = getOperations().sendNoop();  // isConnected is true

and loggedIn is always false (since credentials are wrong in this case), causing new connect, without disconnecting previous connection, for every poll.

        if (!loggedIn || !isConnected) {
            loggedIn = getOperations().connect((RemoteFileConfiguration) endpoint.getConfiguration());

3. Problem with leaking connections is also seen for Ftp producers, suggesting that solution could be done in common part for consumers and producers.

----------

Possible solutions:
1. In FtpOperations.java could disconnect if login failed

{code}
if (!login) {
    throw new GenericFileOperationFailedException(client.getReplyCode(), client.getReplyString());
}
{code}

Changed to:

{code}
if (!login) {
    client.disconnect();
    throw new GenericFileOperationFailedException(client.getReplyCode(), client.getReplyString());
}
{code}

2. Disconnect regardless of what goes wrong, maybe a more robust solution. In FtpOperations.java

{code}
public boolean connect(RemoteFileConfiguration configuration) throws GenericFileOperationFailedException {
{code}

Changed to:

{code}
public boolean connect(RemoteFileConfiguration configuration) throws GenericFileOperationFailedException {
    try {
        return connectInternal(configuration);
    } catch (GenericFileOperationFailedException e) {
        if (isConnected()) {
            disconnect();
        }
        throw e;
    }
}
   
private boolean connectInternal(RemoteFileConfiguration configuration) throws GenericFileOperationFailedException {
{code}

The pattern is that a client may chose to process a batch of msgs before it acks. If batch processing succeeds the client calls Message.acknowledge(). If it fails, the client may choose to recover the msgs in the batch with Session.recover()


The Session is however not exposed to the client, which makes it impossible to call Session.recover(). CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE has IMHO currently limited use because of this.

My Docker Server version is 1.6.0.

Anyway, I've upgraded my version one week ago and the tests was ok. I've pushed two commits (related to client configuration options) in last days, but I don't think the problem is there: I've removed my lines of code and the problem still remains.

Thank you.

In an OSGi environment, each bundle will have its own classloader but Dozer's architecture makes it impossible to cater for this scenario nicely. Unfortunately, it expects a single container-wide classloader configured in the BeanContainer singleton.


In Camel we worked around this by providing a custom DozerClassLoader implementation that is aware of the Camel Context, but what happens if we are sharing Dozer across multiple Camel Contexts? The most recently initialized context will override the container-wide classloader.


We need a solution such that the classloader can dynamically change based on the Camel Context that is using the component.","raulvk:1429764528:2015-04-23T12:48:48.056+0000:1429764528:2015-04-23T12:48:48.056+0000:Fix pushed to branch [fix/CAMEL-8689-camel-dozer-classloading-issue|https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/fix/CAMEL-8689-camel-dozer-classloading-issue].

I noticed a bug where the body (StreamCache) was already removed before the exchange reached the end (in the Wiretap route).


I added a test as an attachment.


f you run the test you can clearly see the temp file deletion followed by the closed stream exception:


Tried 1 to delete file: /var/folders/db/brq60fqj4vb8mnx_5nlz36nw0000gn/T/camel/camel-tmp-00cd1ce2-7d44-47fe-b357-008e8146f770/cos8797132745923044996.tmp with result: true

I encountered the same issue during a more complex route that does some splitting (zip file) and multicasting. This occurred on Camel 2.14.1 so it could be fixed by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-8284 but I need to test this.


Kind regards,

{quote}
My original proposal to copy the stream cache file is not the optimal 
solution. A better solution would be to have only one stream cache 
file and to delete this file only when all exchanges which need this 
file are done. This does mean we have to register listeners to the 
event onDone of all UnitOfWorks of the relevant exchanges in the 
stream cache file object and only when all listeners have got the 
onDone event, then the file can be deleted.  However this will require 
quite some changes 

Probably we could also use this solution for the agregator and splitter case..

Here is the patch. It consists of two files. One for camel-core and one for camel-netty-http.

I had to change the clone() method in the interface StreamCache to

StreamCache clone(Exchange exchange)

because I needed to count the exchanges which are relevant for the cached file.

From what I can see, the problem is located in AggregatorProcessor (github link). The output from doAggregate is ignored, even though it contains the exchange with the exception. The exchange that is used from here on out is the original input to the route, not the aggregated output. 


The only way I can see that would trigger the exception would be to add a custom errorHandler that re-throwed the exception. Unfortunately this is also impossible. The errorHandler on AggregatorProcessor is set in the constructor, and there is no API to set the errorHandler from AggregatorDefinition. The errorHandler set on the route is also ignored by AggregatorProcessor (it will though be invoked with the original not-aggregated exchange).


This problem has been reported earlier in CAMEL-1546. The proposed solution with using a seda route is not satisfactory for cxf endpoints since the calling thread would return.",davsclaus:1436407906:2015-07-09T10:11:46.934+0000:1436407906:2015-07-09T10:11:46.934+0000:The aggregator runs in separate output route that is not assoicated with the inputs.

It does set CamelNettyRemoteAddress in properties of the exchange.

It appears that the latter does not actually contain the remote address. Possible solutions are:
1) Change NettyEndpoint to set CamelNettyRemoteAddress in headers from the AddressedEnvelope received
2) Change NettyEndpoint to set CamelNettyRemoteAddress from properties (and to set properties of the Exchange first)","njiang:1429661514:2015-04-22T08:11:54.143+0000:1429661514:2015-04-22T08:11:54.143+0000:Thanks for reporting this, I just wrote a simple test and produce the error.

Few years ago there was similar issue (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-1838), and it was fixed by adding in RemoteFileConsumer:
this.setPollStrategy(new RemoteFilePollingConsumerPollStrategy());


However it is broken again, as FtpEndpoint is overriding it with DefaultPollingConsumerPollStrategy in initConsumerProperties method, inherited from ScheduledPollEndpoint. I believe RemoteFilePollingConsumerPollStrategy should be used as default in RemoteFileEndpoint as well.


Adding this.setPollStrategy(new RemoteFilePollingConsumerPollStrategy()); in RemoteFilePollingConsumerPollStrategy should fix this issue.


Workaround for this bug is to create RemoteFilePollingConsumerPollStrategy in the registry and provide it directly to FTP endpoint by adding consumer.pollStrategy=#myRemoteFilePollingConsumerPollStrategyBeanId to the URL. This is also why FromFtpSimulateNetworkIssueRecoverTest didn't catch it - it's using custom PollingStrategy.","davsclaus:1436408393:2015-07-09T10:19:53.301+0000:1436408393:2015-07-09T10:19:53.301+0000:Can you work on a patch or something to better explain what you think needs to be fixed?

For example the application classloader associated with a CamelContext is not a dynamic thing. You are supposed to


1. Create the CamelContext 
2. Configure it (i.e. setApplicationContextClassLoader, etc)
3. Start the CamelContext


Reconfiguring the CamelContext at runtime would lead to undefined behaviour. If a higher level supports dynamicity in that classloader, it should set the application classloader to something that supports that.


Dynamicity in classloading is generally problematic because Java does not have a notion of ""unload class"", which would apply to the remove and replace cases.


For example:



CL loads type A1 - CL gets reconfigured so that A1 is no longer available - loading of A1 is now inconsistent
CL loads type A1 - CL gets reconfigured so that A1 is something else - loading of A1 is again inconsistent",

However it is a case of one of ManagedSuspendableRoute object out of existing 214 in the system.

It is for a route:

Suggested solution:
a) form values should be stored separately, or
b) populating headers from the form should fail if a header with this key already exists
c) prefixing keys coming from the form with something, for instance ""form.""


Solution a is a safer solution which will break compatibility with previous versions of Apache Camel (it can also be spread over a number of releases, first introducing new field for form values and logging a warning if form data is being extracted, next making it configurable and disabled by default, then removing this functionality).
Solution b is backwards compatible if this behaviour is not used as a feature  (if it is, it should not). That said someone could still use it to populate RestletRequest-like headers in the Message.
Solution c would be rather ok as well, but I like a more, personally.


I can provide a patch if any solution is accepted.","davsclaus:1436408523:2015-07-09T10:22:03.556+0000:1436408523:2015-07-09T10:22:03.556+0000:You are welcome to work on a patch for c, and also add some option to turn this form -> header mapping on/off.

We encountered an issue which is strongly correlated to the issue described above.

We saw that in the outgoing restlet response, incoming request form parameters are attached. In our case, one of these form parameters were having a newline character. The response went through a HAProxy instance, marking the response header (which was actually a request header) as having an unauthorized character, provoking a HTTP 502 bad gateway.

In the end, the incoming form parameters should not be routed back to the response, so I did an effort implementing solution c prefixing the keys. It is however not ""toggleable"", but you might want to use this as a base to fix this issue.

I've attached the patched files.

Kind regards

I totally agree with you there's absolutely no security risk with the usage of these _non-secure_ random.

That being said, there are a *lot* of static code analyzers. For me updating the code will:
* prevent this kind of false-positive issues from being created again and again
* reduce the noises from these analysis reports and potentially detect real issues that are not drowned in false-positive.

Regards,

Antoine

Using SecureRandom in areas that don't need the the security it provides causes the system entropy to be drained and then not available in the cases where real secure random numbers are required.   That can cause performance problems across the system.

This should be closed as not a problem."

So I was thinking to submit the PR with Lucene and Solr updated at the same time.

What do you think?

RabbitMQ RPC Sample: https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-six-java.html


Currently, to receive and reply in RPC is required (as server):


RouteSample.java
from(""rabbitmq://rabbit-server:5672/myExc?routingKey=myQueue&queue=myQueue&vhost=myVhost&autoAck=false&prefetchEnabled=true&prefetchCount=10&concurrentConsumers=10&declare=true"")
.transacted ()
.setProperty (RabbitMQConstants.REPLY_TO) .header (RabbitMQConstants.REPLY_TO)
.to (""sql: ......"")
.setHeader (RabbitMQConstants.ROUTING_KEY) .property (RabbitMQConstants.REPLY_TO)
.setHeader (RabbitMQConstants.EXCHANGE_NAME) .simple ("""")
.to(""rabbitmq://rabbit-server:5672/_required_fake_field?routingKey=_required_fake_field&vhost=myVhost&threadPoolSize=1"");




So you must save ""reply_to"" from header to properties, set fake exchange and routing key, and overwrite with setHeader.


Would be simpler:



The consumer save the reply_to in properties.
Enable exchange and routing key blank.
Use reply_to property as routhing key when exchange and key is blank.



Test unit for improvement:


ProducerTest.java
    private RabbitMQEndpoint endpoint = Mockito.mock(RabbitMQEndpoint.class);
    private Exchange exchange = Mockito.mock(Exchange.class);
    private Message message = new DefaultMessage();
    private Connection conn = Mockito.mock(Connection.class);
    private Channel channel = Mockito.mock(Channel.class);;

    @Before
    public void before() throws IOException {
        Mockito.when(exchange.getIn()).thenReturn(message);
        Mockito.when(endpoint.connect(Matchers.any(ExecutorService.class))).thenReturn(conn);
        Mockito.when(conn.createChannel()).thenReturn(null);
    }

       @Test
       public void testRpcReplyTo() throws Exception {             
             message = Mockito.mock(Message.class);
             Mockito.when(exchange.getIn()).thenReturn(message);         
             Mockito.when(message.getHeader(RabbitMQConstants.EXCHANGE_NAME, String.class)).thenReturn("""");
             
             Mockito.when(conn.createChannel()).thenReturn(channel);
             RabbitMQProducer producer = new RabbitMQProducer(endpoint);
             exchange.setFromEndpoint(endpoint);
             exchange.setProperty(RabbitMQConstants.REPLY_TO, ""queue_to_reply"");
             
             producer.process(exchange);

The main reason is that the client is connecting via socket to Camel and is waiting for a response else it times out. Camel is sending the request via RPC to the backend and waiting as well. Right now we have to write the RPC code manually as written in the RabbitMQ documentation. The main argument for RPC here was that one did want to run into a scenario where the backend takes long time and returns messages after the client has closed the socket. Although it is always more suited to go with event-driven, sometimes its not possible for various reasons so it would be nice to have better functionality to support it."

The performance should be relatively the same. The per-instance memory usage should be smaller and Camel may decide to opt-in to use some of the additional features. The only drawback is that the jar size is larger due to code generation, though that may be trimmed over time and usually is not a concern for server-side applications.


ConcurrentLinkedHashMap changes will continue to be minimal, even more so now, and driven by requests from Java 6 users unable to upgrade. Caffeine is ideally the upgrade path for Guava cache users too, which due to Android cannot be significantly modified.

This has the effect of scheduled workflows immediately moving to the TIMEOUT state (and being tracked as timed out in the AWS SWF UI).


workarounds
For newcomers to the aws-swf component this is particularly confusing. My work-around was to explicitly create the workflow type in the AWS SWF UI before camel had a chance to register it with proper timeouts (the UI requires you to set a timeout, which may mean there's also a bug in the AWS API). Another approach looks to be related to the workflowTypeRegistrationOptions uri option on the aws-swf endpoint, though I haven't validated that approach as a work-around for this issue, so explore at your own risk.","davsclaus:1428127659:2015-04-04T14:07:39.540+0000:1428127659:2015-04-04T14:07:39.540+0000:Thanks for reporting.

{code}
  public String[] startWorkflowExecution(String workflowId, String runId, String eventName, String version, Object arguments) {
        DynamicWorkflowClientExternalImpl dynamicWorkflowClientExternal = (DynamicWorkflowClientExternalImpl) getDynamicWorkflowClient(workflowId, runId);

        WorkflowType workflowType = new WorkflowType();
        workflowType.setName(eventName);
        workflowType.setVersion(version);
        dynamicWorkflowClientExternal.setWorkflowType(workflowType);

Proving the concept could start with developing the camel-rx module further to see how far we can go with the current components, and CamelContext and Exchange objects.

In the above scenario, while trying to add 11th entry into the map, the eldest entry is evicted as expected but soon after the eviction the LRUCache.onEviction clears cache, which i am wondering is not the expected behavior of LRU Cache.


This happens because LRUCache.stopOnEviction is always set to true during the LRUCache instantiation which triggers ServiceHelper.stopService on eviction.

The stop operation is only for services. But the idempotent repo contains String values for the file names, so the stop dont have any matter.

It must be something else on your end."

As people who are using jackson, may need to configure it before it can be used for conversion. And the type converter dont support that configuration, it just creates a bare ObjectMapper. That only works for simpler use cases. 

But when people want to configure custom jackson modules, and a ton of other option jackson supports then they fall short. Instead the real data formatter of jackson should be used.

It's really pain in the ass not to have Map => Object POJO fallback converter in Camel. This is really common conversion and believe we should support it.

I propose then to:
- keep the conversion
- exclude some common non-Pojo types from it (String, Number, primitives)
- add option to lookup for the ObjectMapper in the registry, so people can provide their own preconfigured instances

What do you think?

Yeah the TC should really only be about custom class types, and not objects from the JDK.
And yeah to lookup the object mapper / or jackson data format to use would be better.

{code}
public void foo(List myList)
{code}

And call that from a camel bean, then camel-jackson may attempt to do a string -> list as json conversion and fail. And each of these hits cost a performance penalty in case you hide this failure. Which shields the fact a json conversion shouldnt be attempted.

I would love to use the camel-swagger component to provide a live API document of the Rest API's configured, but it seems that it is not possible without configuring a web.xml file.


Is this feasible? Is there an alternative to document the Rest API the camel context provides?

The reason for that is the following code in S3Consumer:


S3Consumer.java
            if (!getConfiguration().isDeleteAfterRead()) {
                // where marker is track
                marker = listObjects.getMarker();
            }




Accordingly to S3 client documentation, getMarker() return a marker previously set in request. Instead, getNextMarker() shall be used. Although, simply changing it to use getNextMarker() introduces an endless loop iterating over the same set of keys under the prefix, because when reached the end of the key set, getNextMarker() returns null, and on the next poll, the head of the list will be returned, and so on.","davsclaus:1436409361:2015-07-09T10:36:01.054+0000:1436409361:2015-07-09T10:36:01.054+0000:Wonder what kind of solution could be done then?

I think something like the idempotent option on the file-component is needed to use the S3consumer with deleteAfterRead set to false. There is a isTruncated() method on the objectlisting that indicates if there are more pages in the listing.

Note that using the consumer with deleteAfterRead=false only read the files once so the consumer will never detect new files in the bucket.

    CAMEL-8538 Add inOut support to the camel-rabbitmq component

    This adds several major features to the camel-rabbitmq component that the camel-jms component has. InOut support that spins up a temporary reply queue that supports timeouts. Serializing / de-serializing objects that implement Serializable. Transfers exceptions that occur in consumers.
    
    Added the following URI options (same usage as camel-jms)
    transferException
    requestTimeout
    requestTimeoutCheckerInterval

Currently Hazelcast component creates its own HZ instance regardless if a reference to a HZ instance is provided or not. So in the case of a reference of HZ instance is provided, the one created by the component does not get shutdown - see below code snippet, doesn't get shutdown. So one end up with multipole instances.


I believe the component should not create its own instance at the doStart() method. It should first check if a reference to HZ instance is provided, if yes then use it and if not create its own. 


I have made the changes to reflect the correct behaviour described above. The changes will make sure only one instance of HZ is created. Also, added the ability to reference HZ instance by its name.


What remains?

Update the wiki to show how to reference HZ by its name
Update the wiki to show the newly introduced parameter (hazelcastInstanceName)
Update the wiki to ideally show an example of how to publish HZ instance as an OSGI service for reuse by multiple bundles.




Changes made

No longer the component creates its own HZ instance in doStart() method.
When the component is initialised, only one instance is either been created or use the referenced on in the endpoint.
Ability to reference HZ instance by its name. This will serve the use case whereby the hazelcast cluster is running remotely or not part of the camel context.




HazelcastComponent.java
 @Override
    public void doStart() throws Exception {
        super.doStart();
        if (hazelcastInstance == null) {
            createOwnInstance = true;
            hazelcastInstance = createOwnInstance();
        }
    }




I have created a pull request for this, details can be seen here: https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/443","akhettar:1427170533:2015-03-24T12:15:33.259+0000:1427170533:2015-03-24T12:15:33.259+0000:Hi 

I have provided a patch fix for this improvement as a form of a pull request:  https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/443. Once happy with the changes, do let me know. I will be happy to update the camel wiki for this component too.

One may disagree with this improvement in relation to referencing a HZ instance by its name, but certainly the component should not create more than one HZ instance. The cluster capability of HZ makes more sense in the world of multiple JVM or VM.

Thanks

I have updated the wiki. For the new parameter (hazelcastInstanceName) said it's going to be available in camel 2.16 (not sure if it will end up in the previous version, I believe it should). I have also included samples how to use hazelcast reference by its name, the actual instance and as an OSGI service.

Changing this dependency will make {{camel-ognl}} unable to work in an OSGi environment.

Thomas, can you explain why you need the original version and not the repackaged one by ServiceMix ?

Thanks

The karaf features are using the SMX ognl bundle. Just like all the other features does.

In that case, since the {{ognl}} jar has no OSGi metadata, it won't work. You will need to do the following in your {{pom.xml}}
{code:xml}
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
            <artifactId>camel-ognl</artifactId>

            <exclusions>
                <!-- Not an OSGi bundle, see OSGified version below -->
                <exclusion>

            <version>3.0.8_1</version>
        </dependency>
{code}

Thus, I was wondering why it's not possible to directly use the repackaged version ?

At build time camel-ognl has dependencies on plain ognl, which in any execution environment except OSGi also become runtime dependencies. So in flat classpath env but also in a modular env camel-ognl must see the types from ognl.

In an OSGi environment there must be a bundle deployed that exports ognl types (i.e. the smx ognl bundle). The maven compile time dependency from camel-ognl to ognl does not mean (and should not cause) ognl to be deployed as a bundle. Whatever configures the OSGi runtime must deploy both the camel-ognl bundle and a bundle for ognl itself. This should however not leak into non-osgi environments.

The SMX OGNL bundle is OSGi specific and should not leak into non-osgi environments only because camel-ognl declares a maven compile time dependency on it."

Just add spring-boot-starter-web to your project. It will block the main thread. Or camel-boot-starter-remote-shell. I didn't backported CAMEL-8532 because it is as easy to block the main thread. I personally always add spring-boot-starter-web to the app to have a Jolokia endpoint exposed. 

I hope that resolves the issue. :)

In 2.15.0, ConnectionConfiguration calls DNSUtil.resolveXMPPDomain(serviceName) which runs this code:


DNSUtil.java
public static List<HostAddress> resolveXMPPDomain(final String domain) {
        if (dnsResolver == null) {
            List<HostAddress> addresses = new ArrayList<HostAddress>(1);
            addresses.add(new HostAddress(domain, 5222));
            return addresses;
        }
        return resolveDomain(domain, 'c');
    }




dnsResolver is never initialised, so it returns the service name, in my case 'jabberzac.org', instead of the actual XMPP server from the SRV Record, 'xmpp.jabberzac.org', which then causes a timeout.


The dnsResolver is meant to be instantiated in init(), which is meant to be called by SmackConfiguration, but never is.


DNSUtil.java
    /**
     * Initializes DNSUtil. This method is automatically called by SmackConfiguration, you don't
     * have to call it manually.
     */
    public static void init() {
        final String[] RESOLVERS = new String[] { ""javax.JavaxResolver"", ""minidns.MiniDnsResolver"",
                        ""dnsjava.DNSJavaResolver"" };
        for (String resolver :RESOLVERS) {
            DNSResolver availableResolver = null;
            String resolverFull = ""org.jivesoftware.smack.util.dns"" + resolver;
            try {
                Class<?> resolverClass = Class.forName(resolverFull);
                Method getInstanceMethod = resolverClass.getMethod(""getInstance"");
                availableResolver = (DNSResolver) getInstanceMethod.invoke(null);
                if (availableResolver != null) {
                    setDNSResolver(availableResolver);
                    break;
                }
            }
            catch (ClassNotFoundException|NoSuchMethodException|SecurityException|IllegalAccessException|IllegalArgumentException|InvocationTargetException e) {
                LOGGER.log(Level.FINE, ""Exception on init"", e);
            }
        }
    }




2.14.1 doesn't seem to have this problem as DNSUtil class in 2.14.1 doesn't have an init() function which is meant to be 'automatically called', it just has a static code block:



    static {
        try {
            Hashtable env = new Hashtable();
            env.put(""java.naming.factory.initial"", ""com.sun.jndi.dns.DnsContextFactory"");

I believe this may easily be fixed by adding square braces to the list of chars which need encoding in the UnsafeUriCharactersEncoder.encodeHttpURI method.  This method is being called on line 215 of the HttpHelper class earlier in the processing.


Adding '[' and ']' to the static unsafeCharactersHttp initializer should cause those characters to be encoded and prevent this exception.


I see there is an unsafeCharactersRfc1738 set, which includes square braces, perhaps this could be used instead? I'm not sure the reason there are separate characters lists in this class.

The '[' and ']' are removed from Http endpoint due to CAMEL-6914 for supporting the IPV6.
So I just have a quick question for you.
What's your proxy camel route looks like?

raulvk:1426735793:2015-03-19T11:29:53.699+0000:1426735793:2015-03-19T11:29:53.699+0000:Hello,

This data format should have been depending on Castor 1.3.2, not on the SMX bundle for Castor 1.3.2. You are right.

However, the problem is that vanilla Castor is not OSGi-ready. Upgrading to Castor 1.3.3 without a corresponding OSGi-bundle from the SMX community effectively creates a version fork.

The problem is that the camel-castor unit tests would run against vanilla Castor 1.3.3 whereas OSGi users would be using a lower version. This leaves the community in a brittle position, as it makes it relatively easy to introduce new features that are not backward compatible without anyone realising – because no test would report it.

Therefore I can see two solutions:
* Contribute an upgraded OSGi bundle to the SMX community (quite a simple task) – but then we have to wait for their next bundles release so we can use it.
* Create 2 JUnit executions for this component: one against the OSGi bundle, one against the latest vanilla Castor library.

Ideas?

Regards,
Raúl.

The non-existence of a castor-1.3.3 bundle should IMHO not prevent Camel to move forward and upgrade the castor library. The OSGi community  may want to provide a castor-1.3.3 bundle, which Camel can then integrate in its Karaf feature definition. There may however never be a call for a castor-1.3.3 bundle.

For the WildFly Camel integration, it would AFAICS also work to stick with castor-1.3.2 and only fix the dependency from camel-castor to (non-osgi) castor-xml

For me it would be ok to have this component depend on the latest release of castor-xml as long as we also have a JUnit execution against the latest OSGi-fied bundle. That would serve us as a regression test.

Do you have experience with multiple JUnit executions with different dependencies by any chance?

Raúl.

Don't really understand your OSGi rational here. We test that the camel-castor component works correctly with the castor-x.y.z codebase. To test OSGi functionality, you would need to run both in an OSGi framework. In other words, running a plain JUnit test in camel-castor with a dependency on a castor bundle, does by no means verify that this combination works in an OSGi environment.

The goal is to test whether the component presents no regressions when tested against the latest OSGi bundle, e.g. if we upgrade the component to castor-xml 1.3.3 but the latest OSGi bundle continues to be for castor-xml 1.3.2, I want to guarantee zero regressions by running the unit tests against castor-xml 1.3.2 also (bundle dependency).
tdiesler:1426744549:2015-03-19T13:55:49.324+0000:1426744549:2015-03-19T13:55:49.324+0000:I see, you mean if there are code changes in camel-castor that work with castor-1.3.3, but not with the castor-bundle-1.3.2.
The PR now uses a dependency on castor-xml-1.3.2 - the version disconnect is gone.  
raulvk:1426744897:2015-03-19T14:01:37.434+0000:1426744897:2015-03-19T14:01:37.434+0000:Yeah, although in practice it wouldn't be necessary for this particular upgrade. After all, if Castor is doing sane versioning, a micro version upgrade shouldn't break anything. But I could foresee a possible upgrade to Castor 2.0, and then we could've really had a problem.

In fact, my idea was aimed to pave the way for further upgrades in Castor in case the SMX community was not interested/active enough to keep up with the update rhythm of the upstream projects (and to benefit any other components which are, or can be, in a similar situation).

This should be changed so it is possible to define a readPreference for MongoDB consumers.

    CAMEL-8483: Removed readPreference from the list of invalid options for camel consumer endpoints

    Hi,
    This one is about the issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-8483, also discussed here:
    http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/MongoDB-Consumer-Endpoint-ReadPreference-cannot-be-set-tc5764015.html
    
    I simply removed the ""readPreference"" option from the list of invalid options, which should allow you to define MongoDB consumer endpoints with a non-default readPreference (for example to consume data from a tailable consumer by reading from the secondary hosts in a MongoDB replica set).
    
    This is my first GitHub commit/Pull request, so I hope I didn't break anything :).
    
    Best regards,
    Joerg

Restarting the camel context does not help either. Restart of Spring application context is required.


Example that works for Spring managed beans:


package se.comhem.service;


import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.cloud.context.config.annotation.RefreshScope;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;


@Component
@RefreshScope()

    @Value(""${cosmos.someappconf}"")
    private String someAppConf;


    public String getSomeAppConf()

{
        return someAppConf;
    }



}


When using this bean together with a camel routebuilder it does not work until Spring Application context is restarted:


package se.comhem.service;


import org.apache.camel.model.language.SimpleExpression;
import org.apache.camel.spring.SpringRouteBuilder;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;


@Component
public class ConfigClientRouteBuilder extends SpringRouteBuilder {
pansowa
    private final static String URI = ""servlet:///testCamel"";


    @Autowired

    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception 

{
        from(URI)
                .setBody(new SimpleExpression(cosmosProperties.getSomeAppConf()))
                .to(""log:se.comhem?level=INFO&showBody=true&multiline=true"")
                .end();

    }


}


Main application class:

The TryProcessor will iterate over any number of processors defined inside of it and during each iteration it sets the out msg to the in msg and clears the out msg reference.  The end result of this is that when the route completes, the out reference is cleared and Exchange.isFailed() will return false (it checks the out message for fault status).  Here’s where things get interesting, if I add a single processor after the doTry block, some logic in Pipeline kicks in that copies the in message to the out message for InOut MEPs before ending the route.


I have included a unit test which demonstrates the expected behavior and current (unexpected) behavior.  The expected behavior test fails and the unexpected behavior test passes.

Suppose one defines a bean called “helloBean” with the following two methods:



public void hello(String first) 
public void hello(String first, String last) 




The following Camel route will distinguish one method from the other. 



from(""timer://foo?repeatCount=1"")
.beanRef(""helloBean"", ""hello('Wilma')"")
.beanRef(""helloBean"", ""hello('Wilma','Flintstone')"");




Now alter the two methods to have them accept a Camel Exchange, as follows:



public void hello(String first, Exchange ex1)
public void hello(String first, String last, Exchange ex1) 




The same Camel route will not be able to distinguish one method from the other. The route will throw either an AmbiguousMethodCallException or ParameterBindingException exception. 


If, on the other hand, you remove one of the methods, and alter the route accordingly, then the route will work just fine and the exchange will be implicitly passed to the method. For example, 



public void hello(String first, String last, Exchange ex1) 

from(""timer://foo?repeatCount=1"")
.beanRef(""helloBean"", ""hello('Wilma','Flintstone')"");",davsclaus:1436410419:2015-07-09T10:53:39.091+0000:1436410419:2015-07-09T10:53:39.091+0000:The binding is already flexible and complicated. And its more for binding non Camel types. If you want Exchange then just have that as a single-arg.

I've just tried to execute the following test against the Camel master (2.16-SNAPSHOT):

{code}
@SpringBootApplication
public class DoubleStartTest extends FatJarRouter {

    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from(""direct:test"").to(""mock:test"");
    }

    @Test
    public void xxx() {
        DoubleStartTest.main(""--spring.main.sources="" + DoubleStartTest.class.getName());
    }

}
{code}

Everything seems to work like a charm. The routes and context have been started only once:

I can confirm that I see cleaner context startup with 2.16-SNAPSHOT.

But I am not sure that the lifecycle contracts are being maintained?
A processor registered in a route is being started twice:
{code}
2015-04-19 10:28:20.535  INFO 21330 --- [           main] melLifecycleMonitorRoute$$anon$1$$anon$2 : create: 1

{code}

Here's the code I used:

{code}
@Configuration
class CamelLifecycleMonitorConfiguration {
  @Bean def CamelLifecycleMonitorRoutes(ef: ExchangeFormatter): RouteBuilder = {
    new RouteBuilder() {
      override def configure(): Unit = {

        val creates = new AtomicInteger()
        val starts = new AtomicInteger()
        val stops = new AtomicInteger()

        from(""direct:camelLifecycleMonitor"")
          .process(new Processor with Service with StrictLogging {

            {
              val c = creates.incrementAndGet()
              logger.info(s""create: $c"")
            }

            override def stop(): Unit = {
              val c = stops.incrementAndGet()
              logger.info(s""stop: $c"")
            }

            override def start(): Unit = {
              val c = starts.incrementAndGet()
              logger.info(s""start: $c"")
            }

            override def process(exchange: Exchange): Unit = {
              logger.info(ef.format(exchange))
            }
          })
      }
    }
  }
}
{code}

Do I not understand the lifecycle contract? Is my test wrong?
Or is there a bug in the framework code?

TIA,
Steven

jhberges:1430892970:2015-05-06T14:16:10.849+0000:1430892970:2015-05-06T14:16:10.849+0000:I think this is a case of multiple levels of application contexts.
I've debugged this down to {{org.apache.camel.spring.boot.RoutesCollector}}.
For my clients case, this seems to happen when spring-boot-actuator-starter is used.

One fix might be that {{RoutesCollector}} only process the route beans when it is the root context that has been refreshed?

Details: the {{onApplicationEvent}} callback is called twice with the following contexts, from breakpoint [here|https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-spring-boot/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/spring/boot/RoutesCollector.java#L52]:
{code}
org.springframework.context.event.ContextRefreshedEvent[source=org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.AnnotationConfigEmbeddedWebApplicationContext@26be9a6: startup date [Wed May 06 15:56:32 CEST 2015]; parent: org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.AnnotationConfigEmbeddedWebApplicationContext@28b46423]
org.springframework.context.event.ContextRefreshedEvent[source=org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.AnnotationConfigEmbeddedWebApplicationContext@28b46423: startup date [Wed May 06 15:55:18 CEST 2015]; root of context hierarchy]
{code}

Adding the routes on the latter would be correct for our case.

I'll investigate wether or not some dependency management may solve it, else I'll do a forked tweak for my specific use

    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-8460, that works for me.
    
    A bit difficult to write unit test for, since this requires multiple ApplicationContext instances to have been started.
    
    I also would image there's a better way to implement this - perhaps by checking for existing routes before adding them?
    I don't know, but this simple tweak works for us - so it's good enough for us, for now.

This is the case for example when using spring-cloud-config. See:

http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/docs/1.0.3/spring-cloud.html#_the_bootstrap_application_context

As soon as spring-cloud-config is enabled in a camel spring boot application (i.e. include the org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-config dependency) Camel context does not get to be initialized, as test expression at line 58 evaluates to false even for the initial context refresh event at application initialization.

The same problem will arise for any applications that use Spring Boot's fluent builder API (see: http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-spring-application.html#boot-features-fluent-builder-api) that provides methods to programmatically create multiple contexts with a parent/child relationship.

    CAMEL-8460: Revert simplistic workaround

    Workaround failed to initialize routes in case of multiple contexts
    with parent/child relationship. Reverted check for `null` parent
    application context in `onApplicationEvent()` and added assertions in
    unit test to verify correct initialization.

This doesn't work when Spring instantiates the Camel's application context as child of another applicationContext. This e.g. happens as soon as you're using spring-cloud-config.
    
    This proposed change brings back RouteCollector's constructor from camel version 2.15.2 and aims to fix both [the initial reason for the change](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/issues/438) and the [bug introduced with the change](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-8460).

Our use case:
Add documentation to route in code and show it on a graph of Camel contexts, routes and endpoints in a running system. Graph is generated from JMX data.


This would be nice data to show on hawtio as well. Although in this case we might want to use an explicit documentation variable rather than a reserved property name.

Unmarshalling as list works but not as iterator. The strange thing here is that list unmarshalling uses the iterator.
In the tests I'm joining the lines according to the {{System.lineSeparator()}} and velocity uses {{System.getProperty(""line.separator"")}}. Do you change the default line separator ? But again, the line separator is working fine for the other separators.

So it might be also relevant for aggregation repositories with optimistic locking for other backends. Problem is that inHeaders of DefaultExchangeHolder is marshalled as LinkedHashMap, which may change physical order of entries, still giving same hash code after unmarshalling.


As workaround - create special class for holding all aggregation properties and not to use more than one header. 


How to reproduce:
create a unit test with embedded hazelcast instance, hazecast agg. repository and let newExchange's have more than one header.","nfx:1425618662:2015-03-06T13:11:02.586+0000:1425618662:2015-03-06T13:11:02.586+0000:Final conclusion - optimistic locking for HazelcastAggregationRepository does not work at all:
- test cases don't cover complex objects like hasmaps and multiple headers
- every time exchange is completed with predicate or with forced shutdown, new property is being added by AggregateProcessor, so cache.remove(key, holder) is always false. so that means, exchange would never be removed, as modified one would have new property set. It might be a good idea to do compare-and-swap on holder without properties. or creating different implementation of holder. or extending a holder. 
- HazelcastAggregationRepository is one of the few final classes within the project, which makes me sad and incapable of extending it

Something wrong is with this injection:
{code}
    @Resource
    private ProducerTemplate producerTemplate;
{code}
only the first route that has it, is initialized.

In the real project ProducerTemplate is injected in some other beans and they are injected in the SpringRouteBuilder ones, and the result is the same.

A typical example of such an email is a release announcement from a free software project.


The marshalled message body should be human-readable but will either:
a) have an ASCII armored signature at the bottom
b) have a signature in a MIME attachment


Maybe the PGP marshaller should just put the binary version of the PGP signature in a header and then other data formats can be used for either the ASCII-armoring or conversion to MIME?


However, if the message body is already MIME (possibly with attachments), then the PGP data format may need to be able to sign each attachment and then the marshalled data will also be a MIME message but with additional signature attachments.


Below is an example of the most simple case, clearsigning ""Hello world"" with the gpg command.  The PGP data format should be able to both marshal the body ""Hello world"" into a message like that below and also unmarshal/verify it.


When unmarshalling the message below, the signature stuff should all be removed and the body will just become ""Hello world"" again.


$ echo ""Hello world"" | gpg --clearsign

Looking at the code, the underlying implementation (fusesource mqtt-client) accepts an array of Topics when creating a subscription.  I have modified the camel-mqtt component to allow for a ""subscribeTopicNames"" option, which expects a comma-delimited list of topics that will be subscribed.


I'm attaching a patch (after creating the issue) that includes additional unit tests for this functionality.  It would be really great if this could be accepted before the 2.14.2 release is cut!


A couple of notes:



If the new ""subscribeTopicNames"" option is specified, anything specified for the existing ""subscribeTopicName"" option will be ignored.  Long term, it doesn't make sense to maintain both options.  Should the singular version be deprecated?  If so, I can submit another patch that deprecates that option within the code.
I don't know how to submit a ""patch"" for the component documentation.  Here's something that would work:






Property
Default
Description


subscribeTopicName
 
The name of the Topic to subscribe to for messages. Deprecated since 2.14.2 (use subscribeTopicNames instead).


subscribeTopicNames
 
Since Camel 2.14.2.  A comma-delimited list of Topics to subscribe to for messages.    Note that each item of this list can contain MQTT wildcards ('+' and/or '#'), in order to subscribe to topics matching a certain pattern within a hierarchy.  For example, '+' is a wildcard for all topics at a level within the hierarchy, so if a broker has topics ""topics/one"" and ""topics/two"", then ""topics/+"" can be used to subscribe to both.  A caveat to consider here is that if the broker adds ""topics/three"", the route would also begin to receive messages from that topic.","mmindenhall:1424777908:2015-02-24T19:38:28.775+0000:1424777908:2015-02-24T19:38:28.775+0000:Adds support for subscribing to multiple MQTT topics (including tests).

As it states on [the XStream page|http://xstream.codehaus.org/json-tutorial.html]: {quote}Since JSON has no possibility to express references, you should always set the NO_REFERENCES mode writing JSON.{quote}

This makes sense, although I am slightly confused because I tested the proposed solution in our own project by extending JsonDataFormat, and it appeared to work. So I cloned the Apache repo and wrote a patch/test for camel-xstream however that fails. I'll look closer at the reason.

We have implemented Hadoop Shim support meaning you can use Hadoop 2.5.2 or
1.2.1. There have been some improvements made to the xML mapping
configurations.
We have some improvements for the generated data beans so these will need
to be regenerated as well.
The good thing is that there are no API changes, the API is pretty stable
right now.
I'll try and take a look into a patch very soo. Once I finish my work on
Chukwa.

I managed to reproduce the error on my windows VirtualBox when the firewall is open by default. When I gave the Java right to access the network, the error went away. I guess it could relate the listener right about it.

So I did some change on the mina server just listen to local loop address, it should resolve the error that you hit.

I don't think a simple check on timeout < interval will quite cut it. If the two values are close, it's still a good chance that this behavior will be triggered. 

The most obvious way (at least from my POV), would be to change the {{FileChangedExclusiveReadLockStrategy}}. 
from this {{if (delta > timeout)}} to  {{if (delta > timeout + checkInterval)}}. But that may cause other problems..

https://github.com/chirino/camel/commit/14a30ff094673ac0866db2470bd1247772e7e7d1

I had to add a method to the InflightRepository so that I could order the exchanges in the right order and restrict the results to the desired route id:
{code}
Collection<InflightExchange> browse(String routeId, int limit, Comparator<InflightExchange> comparator)
{code}

Since adding methods to interfaces can be breaking change, I'm not sure if this is acceptable.

So IMHO it would be better to have logic in the inflight registry that keeps state of the oldest per route and keeps that list up to date when an exchange is done. And then the route mbeans can quickly read that information from the inflight registry without causing computation overhead.

Also the current approach would imho cause to much overhead if users have many routes, and then some jmx tools read all the attributes, which per route causes the ""computing"".

And its okay to add / change the interface in a new minor release such as Camel 2.15. We add the api changes in the release notes.

I’m using the 2.14.2-SNAPSHOT builds at the moment (need a fix I submitted after 2.14.1).  Since I started using the snapshot builds, whenever I click “download sources” in my IDE (so I can view documentation/source as I code against the API), I see the “sources not found” message.  I originally thought the sources were not being built for snapshot builds.
https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/camel/camel-core/2.14.2-SNAPSHOT/
However, after checking the repo with the link above, I was able to see that some builds include the sources and javadoc, and some don’t.  I also noticed that there seem to be two nightly builds which complete 30-60 minutes apart each night, where the first build includes the sources and javadoc, but the second build does not.  
Here are the available builds, the time they completed, and whether the sources/javadoc jars were included:
Fri Feb 13 builds
Build 64   03:18 UTC   yes
Build 65   03:50 UTC   no
Sat Feb 14 build (just one build for some reason)
Build 66   06:33 UTC   yes
Sun Feb 15 builds

Build 68   07:54 UTC   no

Build 70   03:02 UTC   no
Tue Feb 17 builds

Thu Feb 19 builds
Build 75   02:34 UTC   yes
Build 76   03:06 UTC   no
I see the same pattern with the camel component builds as well (two nightly builds, only first has sources/javadoc jars).
Does anyone know what might be happening here?  It would be greatly appreciated if this could be fixed so all the builds include the sources and javadoc!

If you look at what's out in the repo (for camel-core, see link posted in issue), there are two builds for Feb 22:  build 77 and build 78.  Build 77 includes the javadoc and sources, build 78 does not.  When version ""2.14.2-SNAPSHOT"" is specified as a dependency, maven goes out and grabs the latest snapshot available, and uses that.  In this case, it grabbed build 78 (or more precisely 2.14.2-20150222.034718-78, which I verified within my local repository).

To reproduce:

1.  Clean out your ~/.m2/repository/org/apache/camel/camel-core/2.14.2-SNAPSHOT folder
2.  Specify 2.14.2-SNAPSHOT as the version for camel-core within a POM
3.  Build the project
4.  Force maven source download (mvn dependency:sources)
5.  Verify that the build 78 artifacts (or whatever are the latest) were pulled (no sources or javadocs).  The ""mvn dependency:sources"" command will also report which dependencies were resolved (i.e., sources found) and which were not.

Right now it is done in CxfRsInvoker - but may be easily enough refactored for it to be done inside the default binding. I marginally prefer it be done in the invoker so that if someone does write a custom binding without extending the default one the propagation of context still works. The other reason is that for it to work the invoker needs to pass an optional flag to the binding and we'd need a property name for that - and I'd like to do that as part of another refactoring related to where some of JAXRS constants are defined.

So IMHO doing it in the invoker if fine for now. The patch is safe with respect to the existing cxfrs users

It was not possible to just set <from uri=""jetty://http://127.0.0.1:8082?matchOnUriPrefix=true&amp;httpMethodRestrict=OPTIONS"" />. 

Another very interesting issue is that this works now for the uri and the resource endpoint defined above. The transfer endpoint is not working when I call http://127.0.0.1/transfer. I get a 405 - Methode not allowed error. It only works when I call it with some suffix like this http://127.0.0.1/transfer/1.  

The OPTIONS request header looks like:

I noticed that the camel-example-servlet-rest-tomcat sample uses the RestSwaggerCorsFilter (https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/examples/camel-example-servlet-rest-tomcat/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml) to achieve CORS (and not the enableCors flag on the restConfiguration).

With that example CORs works out of the box due to the Swagger filter. 

If you enableCORS on the restConfiguration it will fail because you'll have both the REST component and the restConfiguration putting CORs headers on the response.

Might be interesting to use this example to demonstrate the enableCORS flag.

I tried working around it in a similar way Florian did:

    from(""netty4-http:http://0.0.0.0:8081/products?matchOnUriPrefix=true&httpMethodRestrict=OPTIONS"")
            .setHeader(""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"", constant(""*""))

            .setHeader(""Allow"", constant(""GET, OPTIONS, POST, PATCH""));


but that makes things even more strange. None of the Access-Control-Allow-* headers are returned and now Allow returns OPTIONS twice:

    Allow: OPTIONS,OPTIONS
    Content-Length: 0
    Content-Type: text/plain

I’m using the camel-netty4-http (latest 2.14.2-SNAPSHOT) component to create an endpoint that receives an HTTP POST from a device, translates the message from binary to JSON, then sends it along to a kafka topic for further processing.  When there are errors in validating or translating the incoming message, I need to be able to return a HTTP response code and response body.
The camel-netty4-http documentation has an “Access to Netty types” section, which says that I should be able to do the following to access the instance of io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpResponse:
    HttpResponse response = exchange.getIn(NettyHttpMessage.class).getHttpResponse();
Regardless of where I access the exchange within the route, getHttpResponse() is always returning null.  On the ""happy path” I can return 200 by calling exchange.getOut().setBody(myResponse), but I have been unable to figure out how to return another response code.
Is this a bug?  Or is there another way to accomplish what I’m trying to do?


After digging around in the code, it looks like the HTTP status code is set via the CamelHttpResponseCode message header (org.apache.camel.component.netty4.http.DefaultNettyHttpBinding, line 308).  However, there is no mention of this message header in either the camel-netty-http or camel-netty4-http documentation.  It would be helpful to add this header to the list of applicable message headers, and also to include an example that demonstrates how to set the response status code and body:


Finally, the existing ""Access to Netty types"" example should be modified to be clear that only the request can be accessed in this way.



// specify response body and status
exchange.getOut().setBody(myResponseBody);               exchange.getOut().setHeader(Exchange.HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE, 401);","davsclaus:1424212745:2015-02-18T06:39:05.279+0000:1424212745:2015-02-18T06:39:05.279+0000:If you want to help with doc then see here

figure out how to integrate this with the camel model that is generated from camel-core
how the namespace parsers of spring/blueprint detects these new namespaces for each component
and have it work in all environments, eg standalone, jee, osgi, et all

   ...

{code}

Then inside components, its the components generated schema we use to configure components. The id is likely optional so you can differentiate components or given them a id. But if its omitted, then it should use the default component name, eg jetty for jetty etc.

Now the component schema is maybe a mix of using attributes and elements. And should also allow to use <property> style as well?

As IOconvert.toInputStream just return an InputStream back, it has no chance to use the charset information.
How about use IOconvert.toReader(File file, String charset) directly?

I expected that it transforms the file to a stream using the specified charset. In fact that method uses the charset (can be seen in the implementation), but the resulting stream delivers exactly the same byte sequence as the one without charset specification.

Using  IOconvert.toReader(File file, String charset) would be fine, but will not work for 2.14.x because it is not public in this branch. Besides this is a workaround, but the inconsistency of toInputStream stays.

This seems strange, because anybody can see that the implementation does use the specified charset. However the Streaming-Pipeline (Stream->BufferedReader->Stream) seems to loose it.

As I said - i can hunt this bug down, but yet I am not certain if a majority recognizes this behaviour as bug.

    CAMEL-8356 IOConverter.toInputStream(file, charset) returns strange

    I extended some Unittests to point out the problems:
    - toReader(file, charset) does respect the charset
    - toStream(file, charset) does not respect the charset
    
    The provided Patch for IOConverter.toInputStream does respect the charset. I do not know if other projects already rely on the current behaviour that the charset is completely ignored.

My intension was to provide an Inputstream which could be read by any unparameterized reader / wrapper stream. I will attach a patch for the tests and a fix for IOConverter.toInputStream.

Your cleanup made obvious that my fix converts the stream to UTF-8, which could only be read by readers with UTF-8 (instead of default) input encoding.

The attachment will fix CAMEL-8346 for branch 2.14 but unfortunately breaks branch 2.15. You cannot apply this attachment to branch 2.15.x without another fix for CAMEL-8346.

Notify me if you want to apply this patch. I will try to provide a patch for CAMEL-8346 on branch 2.15.x then.

        if (inputStream == null) return null;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(2048); // Define a size if you have an idea of it.

        } catch (Throwable t) {}
        return sb.toString();
    }

It seems file reading ends with some characters (for example, in cp1251 encoding, file reading ends with characters 'яя'). Camel version 2.15.2, java version 1.8.0_45.

I have a question regarding this issue and the way it was fixed. It seems like there is a defect or maybe I do not understand something, maybe you can help me?

The issue is the following, I have a file consumer that I use to process XML files with UTF-8 charset. In my processor I am taking content of an incoming file like this:
{code:java}
exchange.getIn().getBody(InputStream.class){code}
and then I am passing it to XML parser together with configured charset (UTF-8) to make sure that reader, that is used by XML parser, will consume binary stream correctly. 

The issue is that if default system charset is not UTF-8 (valid case for my application) I am getting question marks instead of Chinese characters. 

After some debugging I found a strange thing, the converted, which is used to give me file body as InputStream, org.apache.camel.converter.IOConverter.toInputStream(File, String) does something strange, it reads characters from the file and them encodes them into system's default charset. This blew my mind, this looks wrong.

When I take body as InputStream I am expecting to get a binary stream, not a re-encoded characters stream. The current behavior seems totally unexpected to me.

Thank you for your answer in advance.

So there are two options:
- allow more flexible creation of parent-child pairs (specifying headers for both of them)
- let jcr producer not to do session.save() after each message received so code can look like that:

{code}
from(""direct:someInput"")
.multicast(""direct:createParent"", ""direct:createChild"", ""direct:saveChanges"");

from(""direct:createParent"")

from(""direct:saveChanges"")
.to(""jcr://user:pass@repo/tmp/parent?noop=true""); //noop would mean that no node should be created

Though in this case session needs to be kept open during Camel context lifetime and I'm not sure how well it fits its architecture.
I'd be grateful if you could help me to understand what would be right solution there and I'll be more than happy to implement it.

But the file:

should be changed:

should now be:

            folderId = exchange.getIn().getHeader(""CamelBoxFolderId"", ""0"", String.class);

on two occasions.

The sed can be invoked by putting it in ~ and running a find from the camel-box folder as:

find . -type f -a -exec sed -i -f ~/box.sed ""{}"" \; 

It builds after this change but will be incompatible with existing users code.

> Any of the options can be provided in a message header for producer endpoints with CamelBox. prefix.

If the prefix header is changed from CamelBox. to CamelBox (without dot). Would the message headers still be able to use as options, as said above?

eg before
{code}
key=CamelBox.folderId
{code}

After
{code}
key=CamelBoxFolderId
{code}

Notice that the first letter of the option is upper cased? Or we can make the case not matter?

I wonder if this requires any change in the core api component or what?

I wasn't aware of the Camel 'no dots in header' convention. I'll have to take a look at the API framework to see if that's affected. At the very minimum code generation maven plugin is affected since it uses that convention for all generated components, and also would make the new components backward incompatible.

Using InputSource as documentType is a particularily bad idea. If the XPath implementation supports it (Saxon does, the JDK implementation doesn't), SAXSource can be a more memory efficient choice for the docuementType. We should probably also change the Javadoc here...

To reproduce:



add multiple messages to a RabbitMQ queue which define an expiration header (after expiration, RabbitMQ will remove those message from queue without delivering them to consumers)
watch RabbitMQ admin panel, you should see n messages are ""Ready"", 0 messages are ""Unacknowledged""
configure & run one concurrent RabbitMQEndpoint from Camel with above settings + autoAck=false and delay/block processing of messages (e.g. by running Thread.wait(10000) in a Processor)
watch the admin panel again: 0 messages are ""Ready"", n messages are ""Unacknowledged"" - so Camel appears to have prefetched all messages?
wait until messages should have expired
admin panel still shows all unprocessed messages as unacknowledged although they should have been removed from queue
Camel still processes those messages after expiration
stop Camel (returns all unacknowledged messages to ready state)
admin panel shows that all messages now have been purged from queue (much later than they should have)



Workaround: Repeating with prefetchEnabled=true and prefetchCount=1 shows only 1 message ""unacknowledged"" while queue is being processed by Camel, all other messages remain ""ready"" and expire in time (thus skipping the Camel queue as expected).


Expected behaviour: If the prefetcher is disabled, no messages should get locked on server-side, so messages can be expired by RabbitMQ as intended by the message sender.","neoramon:1426080402:2015-03-11T21:26:42.452+0000:1426080402:2015-03-11T21:26:42.452+0000:Hello [~dneuge],
The expiration is set in ""properties"", not in the ""header"".
I can't reproduce in RabbitMQ 3.1.4, Erlang R16B01, Apache Camel 2.14.1 and amqp-client 3.3.4.
dneuge:1426126130:2015-03-12T10:08:50.587+0000:1426126247:2015-03-12T10:10:47.130+0000:Sorry, of course I meant the properties. :)

Here it's RabbitMQ 3.2.4, Erlang R15B03-1, Camel 2.14.1, amqp-client 3.3.4. The message is generated via [php-amqplib|https://github.com/videlalvaro/php-amqplib] 2.4.1 (which shouldn't matter):
{code:none}
$msg = new AMQPMessage($msg_body, array(
    'content_type' => 'text/plain',
    'delivery_mode' => 2,
    'expiration' => $timeoutSeconds * 1000,
    //'reply_to' => 'amq.rabbitmq.reply-to'
    'reply_to' => $replyQueueName
));
$ch->basic_publish($msg, $exchangeName);
{code}

It's not in production yet, so I may get an opportunity to try an update next week (I'm currently on vacation). Both RabbitMQ 3.1.4 and 3.2.4 (latest ""stable"" on the Linux distribution we use) are fairly old but since I get that issue on a later version, there might have been some new feature introduced between 3.1 and 3.2 which causes that message locking. The news regarding 3.2.0 says it ""features enhanced policies for aspects of the broker which previously required AMQP arguments"" - maybe that's the culprit unless it's just some bug in RabbitMQ (but then still the client appears to be too eager when querying for messages).

eg if we add support for using * as a wildcard then people can do rest paths with * as suffix, to indicate that it should match by wildcard


eg


 rest(""/api/user/*"") 


To match



/api/user
/api/user/foo
-/api/user/foo/bar

This can be as simple as passing {{matchOnUriPrefix}} to the HTTP transport component in this case. With Spring Web MVC you have a lot of options to map requests to handlers, and one of the option is Ant style globs like {{/path/**}} that matches all nested paths within {{/path}}, but you also have regex support and you can implement custom {{HandlerMapping}} that maps in whatever way you feel is needed.
I don't see the need for Camel to match competencies of other Web frameworks, that is not it's core strength, but detecting {{&#42;}} or {{&#42;&#42;}} and passing that on to the HTTP transport as {{matchOnUriPrefix}} property should suffice.

However some http libraries like vertx-web can route from wildcard (see link and search for wildcard)

According to the Gson documentation, this should not be executed on Generic types as the String will not be parsed, but stored in a JsonPrimitive as opposed to the expected JsonObject.


In order to correct it, is to use the code which parses the String (Sorry, don't have time just now to do a proper patch):

Does this option only really apply to a producer? The code is part of 
org.apache.camel.component.rabbitmq.RabbitMQEndpoint#declareExchangeAndQueue

which both the consumer and producer uses. But it may be that the option only makes sense on the producer side. And if so we can mark the option with label producer so the end users would know.

I didn't though this PR will get merged as-is, I wanted to raise the issue and have a discussion on what is the right approach. I also asked for a feedback from the latest committer in this file here: https://github.com/apache/camel/commit/69de2e3dd8f9d0e61b3a9e6e5495e406c9159909#commitcomment-9381453

First, I can fix the specific broken unit-test. than, If you can please make it clear what is the best way to fix the backward compatibility issue, I will be glad to fix that as well. 

please let me know how to proceed.

MongoDB of course has ISODate. In our case we had to provide a custom ObjectMapper switching off this Date to timestamp converter option. It would be nice if:

Schematron without includes works fine in Karaf. I'm running version 2.15.3. It's just when i include files that they are not found.

We need a way of passing an XML Catalog or URI Resolver that may fix the issue but I doubt it as  the last test failed to find the included file in the file system. Here is the camel example I sued to test the solutions: https://github.com/akhettar/zotix/tree/master/schematron-service.

{code:xml}

This resolver would then be included in the components ClassPathURIResolver and be used as a fallback if the first resolve fail and the clientUriResolver is not null.

Otherwise JdbcProducer won't use the right connection in transacted case.

The latter with XA ought to let the TX manage orchestrate it all about commit / rollback, and just by using the XADataSource it should work - I assume.

For single resource if the idea is to defer the commit to the end of the route, then yeah I guess maybe the connection should be reused or not returned to the pool. So maybe the component detects that the exchange is transacted, eg exchange.isTransacted() and if so it grabs the connection and keep it around, and only return it to the pool when the exchange UoW is done. Well in fact this ought also to work for XA.

In case of XA, datasource.getConnection() may (at least in case of aries-jdbc when working in Fuse) return the same connection, but I'm pretty sure it's not guaranteed.

The attached patch solves this issue. The idea of the patch is to provide a copy of the stream cache to each thread. The copy will use the same cache of the original stream cache, only the stream which accesses the cached data  will be a separate instance. For this, we introduced the new method


   copy()


in the StreamCache class.

I think we should just make camel's stream cache work similar to cxf's stream caching, which can be read multiple times by multiple threads.

the behavior is similar as in CXF:

- For a file cache you can create now several FileInputStream instances. 
- The FileInputStream instances are registered in the FileInputStreamCloser instance. There is a one to one relationship between a FileInputStreamCloser instance and the file cache (CachedOutputStream instance).
- The FileInputSteamCloser instance closes all the registered FileInputStream instances before the file cache is deleted at the end of the route.

I attached an alternative solution 0001-parallel-processable-stream.patch where I do not change the StreamCache interface but where I introduce a new interface ParallelProcessableStream with a copy method.

With this solution, implementations of StreamCache must not be changed.

Please have a look, if this solution can be applied for 2.14 and 2.15.

The above patch does not make changes in the netty component (as suggested by Stephan Siano, see patch 0001-CAMEL-8284-Implement-copy-method-in-NettyChannelBuff.patch) because the implementation of ParallelProcessableStream  is optional for enabling parallel processing. But of course it would make sense to implement the ParallelProcessableStream  in NettyChannelBufferStreamCache.

Would have been lovely if there was a way for byte array input streams to not need to copy the byte[] but reuse the same instance to avoid 2x the memory usage.
But seems like buf[] is protected in the jdk api, and no api to access it.

Also I think we should add the copy method directly to StreamCache so its out of the box. There is to many interfaces already in Camel.

I could reproduce the issue, and added a workaround in camel-exec to catch the stream closed and move on.

But the bug is in commons-exec which likely need to fix that issue.

See stack trace below.  I am not very familiar with how to report that a workaround is still broken in JIRA, so please advise.

I would recommend changing the check to ""if (""stream closed"".equals(msg.toLowerCase())) {""

You should be able to configure the data formats using the rest-dsl style, using the dataFormatProperty. And you can use the prefixies if you want to configure options differently on IN vs OUT etc.
benjamin.habegger:1421652364:2015-01-19T15:26:04.898+0000:1421652364:2015-01-19T15:26:04.898+0000:Well, we had our own implementation of the org.apache.camel.spi.DataFormat interface we were using by creating a bean and referencing it using the rest jsonDataFormat configuration.

In our spring xml file:

<bean id=""myDataFormat"">
<!-- etc. -->
</bean>

In our java RouteBuilder:

rest().jsonDataFormat(""myDataFormat"")
 // etc. 
;

From what, I understand, we don't have any way to use a completely custom DataFormat implementation where as this was possible before. From what I understand the dataFormatProperty only allows to configure an existing dataFormat implementation. Am I wrong ?

Benjamin

But I think we can support custom under the rule, that it has a no-arg default constructor, then we use that to instantiate a new instance, and use the existing data format configuration for you to configure it. Then it should fit like the built in data formats.

You can look at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/context/annotation/MBeanExportConfiguration.java to get some inspiration - but that is really about WAS management extensions.

I downloaded some javadocs from: http://www-01.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/was/library/v85/nd-dp/
and maybe com.ibm.websphere.servlet.container. or com.ibm.websphere.servlet. is more suitable?

As class loader magic becomes more and more common place, this might just break for any future weblogic family application. The name of the WebSphere class loader should however be pretty stable, wouldn't it be easiest to match the exact name? Also, one could add some system property ""-Dcamel.websphereClassLoader"" for overriding this name if it would indeed change before Camel would add this additional name and a user would require this adaption.

This is not for all classloading but only for annotation package scanning, which in Camel 1.x was how it discovered type converters. This has changed a long time ago, and is no longer needed.

Only when using camel-bindy it does some package scanning annotations, only because we havent refactored and migrated camel-bindy to avoid this. There is a jira about that.

There is no need to add a system property and whatnot. You can remove this code and have Camel work in websphere, its only when you use camel-bindy it would may fail. But newer versions of WebSphere may work without this. So if anyone got access to a set of IBM WebSphere App Servers they are welcome to test the situation today.

Also WebSpherePackageScanClassResolver is no harm as it just adds an extra fallback that has no harm for non websphere environments"

The consumer jvm downloads messages very fast from sqs, onto the jvm heap, even though the camel receive method processes each message very slowly (and Ack's when done, with autoAck = false). The result of this is that the consumer jvm continually fills its heap with an unbounded queue of incoming messages and eventually throws OOME.


To avoid this failure, we're looking for a way to enable backpressure when using aws-sqs—e.g. an on-heap bounded queue between the component fetching from sqs and the user-defined actor processing the messages—but I don't see anything relevant in the config:



http://camel.apache.org/aws-sqs.html



Looking at the code, I see that SqsConsumer subtypes ScheduledBatchPollingConsumer, which subtypes ScheduledPollConsumer. To get backpressure, should it use something like EventDrivenPollingConsumer somewhere, which uses a blocking queue to avoid the heap blowup above?

Have you tried using a seda component to block additional polls until in-flight exchanges complete?

to(""seda:seda?blockWhenFull=true&size=2&concurrentConsumers=2&waitForTaskToComplete=Always&timeout=0"")

SQS is a ScheduledBatchPollingConsumer so you will need to set maxMessagesPerPoll.
A value of 1 is probably right if you have ""slow"" consumers.

I don't know if there are any other implications of ScheduledBatchPollingConsumer vs. a simple PollingConsumer so what I say here may not be effective with SQS. ymmv... GL!

I feel that this change, using 2.1.1, should be backported to Camel 2.14 and 2.13.

The jSMPP 2.1.x branch will only be used for minor bug fixes, security fixes, etc.  There won't be any API breaking changes in the 2.1.x branch.

The jSMPP 2.2.x release should probably not be backported to Camel 2.14 or earlier and maybe it won't even be ready for 2.15.

properties

Key                      Description
---                      -----------
hostName                 HDFS host to use
port                     HDFS port to use
path                     The directory path to use
blockSize                The size of the HDFS blocks
bufferSize               The buffer size used by HDFS
checkIdleInterval        How often (time in millis) in to run the idle checker background task. This option is only in use if the splitter strategy is IDLE.
chunkSize                When reading a normal file this is split into chunks producing a message per chunk.
compressionCodec         The compression codec to use
compressionType          The compression type to use (is default not in use)
connectOnStartup         Whether to connect to the HDFS file system on starting the producer/consumer. If false then the connection is created on-demand. Notice that HDFS may take up till 15 minutes to establish a connection as it has hardcoded 45 x 20 sec redelivery. By setting this option to false allows your application to startup and not block for up till 15 minutes.
fileSystemType           Set to LOCAL to not use HDFS but local java.io.File instead.
fileType                 The file type to use. For more details see Hadoop HDFS documentation about the various files types.
keyType                  The type for the key in case of sequence or map files.
openedSuffix             When a file is opened for reading/writing the file is renamed with this suffix to avoid to read it during the writing phase.
owner                    The file owner must match this owner for the consumer to pickup the file. Otherwise the file is skipped.
readSuffix               Once the file has been read is renamed with this suffix to avoid to read it again.
replication              The HDFS replication factor
splitStrategy            In the current version of Hadoop opening a file in append mode is disabled since it's not very reliable. So for the moment it's only possible to create new files. The Camel HDFS endpoint tries to solve this problem in this way: If the split strategy option has been defined the hdfs path will be used as a directory and files will be created using the configured UuidGenerator. Every time a splitting condition is met a new file is created. The splitStrategy option is defined as a string with the following syntax: splitStrategy=ST:valueST:value... where ST can be: BYTES a new file is created and the old is closed when the number of written bytes is more than value MESSAGES a new file is created and the old is closed when the number of written messages is more than value IDLE a new file is created and the old is closed when no writing happened in the last value milliseconds
valueType                The type for the key in case of sequence or map files
bridgeErrorHandler       Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN/ERROR level and ignored.
delay                    The interval (milliseconds) between the directory scans.
initialDelay             For the consumer how much to wait (milliseconds) before to start scanning the directory.
pattern                  The pattern used for scanning the directory
sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle If the polling consumer did not poll any files you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead.
exceptionHandler         To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN/ERROR level and ignored.
pollStrategy             A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel.
append                   Append to existing file. Notice that not all HDFS file systems support the append option.
overwrite                Whether to overwrite existing files with the same name
exchangePattern          Sets the default exchange pattern when creating an exchange
synchronous              Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported).
backoffErrorThreshold    The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in.
backoffIdleThreshold     The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in.
backoffMultiplier        To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured.
greedy                   If greedy is enabled then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again if the previous run polled 1 or more messages.
runLoggingLevel          The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that.
scheduledExecutorService Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool.
scheduler                To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz2 component
schedulerProperties      To configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz2 Spring based scheduler.
startScheduler           Whether the scheduler should be auto started.
timeUnit                 Time unit for initialDelay and delay options.
useFixedDelay            Controls if fixed delay or fixed rate is used. See ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for details.

Is that what you'd expect ?

We could add a --verbose option so you can show columns with: group and default value also. 
And a --filter to filter on the label, so you can do --filter consumer to only show consumer related options etc.

By setting this option to false allows your application to startup and not block for up till 15 minutes.

splitStrategy            common                            In the current version of Hadoop opening a file in append mode is disabled since it's not very reliable. So for the moment it's only possible to create new files. The Camel HDFS endpoint tries to solve this problem in this way: If the split strategy option has been defined the hdfs path will be used as a directory and files will be created using the configured UuidGenerator. Every time a splitting condition is met a new file is created. The splitStrategy option is defined as a string with the following syntax: splitStrategy=ST:valueST:value... where ST can be: BYTES a new file is created and the old is closed when the number of written bytes is more than value MESSAGES a new file is created and the old is closed when the number of written messages is more than value IDLE a new file is created and the old is closed when no writing happened in the last value milliseconds

bridgeErrorHandler       consumer            false         Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.

bridgeErrorHandler       consumer            false         Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN/ERROR level and ignored.

backoffMultiplier        scheduler                         To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured.

runLoggingLevel          scheduler           TRACE         The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that.

I just checked the code of ZooKeeperRoutePolicy, it just shutdown the consumer once the node switches from master mode to salve mode by default.
Can you double check if the old leader switched to the salve mode?

The problem is ZooKeeperRoutePolicy do not re-elect the master for the route having expired session so it keeps considering itself master. However at the same time there is another route elected as master by ZooKeeper. As a result, we got two working master nodes.

Actually, we've done a fix by watching the Zookeeper client if SessionExpired event received, we reset the ZooKeeperElection so that it create a new ElectoralMonitorRoute and do election again next time when isMaster() is call.

Thanks for sharing the solution with us.  I think it's enough to stop and remove the selection route, you don't need to remove the endpoint and create new producerTemplate. The missing part is how to listen the SessionExpired even and call the reset method.
Please feel free to submit a patch or a pull request, I'd happy to help you merge the patch into Apache Camel git repo.

Regards,

Willem

There are many scenarios where somebody would only want to use a single receiver bind


Many providers limit the number of binds and the component creates a lot of noise in the log file when it can't create additional binds because the SMSC rejects the additional connections with negative response code 5.

CxfRsInvoker.performInvocation() can delegate to the superclass if some property is set and only if it is Exchange.InOut and then just set out body on the Camel exchange and let the route continue as usual. I may be missing something else, you'd know best. This way the JAX-RS implementation would act as an implicit ""to(cxfbean:serviceBean)""

The rest of the route then can modify the response if needed and do something else with it. I guess a similar thing can be done by combining an existing cxfrs consumer with the cxfbean...
Thanks, Sergey

I think the way you just showed is workable, but the use case can be implemented by a camel cxfrs proxy route just like this.
{code}
  from(""cxfrs:endpoint1"").to(""cxfrs:endpoint2"").transform(xxx); 
{code}
or 
{code}
  from(""cxfrs:endpoint1"")..transform(xxx).to(""cxfrs:endpoint2"");
{code}
If we want to modify the response, we could also change the implementation directly. So I don't think it's a good idea to support user use the camel-cxfrs endpoint this way.
For ""to(cxfbean:serviceBean)"", it can leverage the camel component to provide some transports those CXF doesn't support, but I don't think people use it that way.

you are probably right; 
As far as I understand the proxy route actually implies invoking on the remore endpoint (endpoint2), right ? 
I was thinking of an optional local service invocation - the service can already be implemented, so in such cases having users do custom processors may not be optimal; I'm still may be missing something though. Let me experiment a bit later with this option and report back; I might offer some patch for you to review.  Please keep this JIRA open for a bit longer, reassign to me in meantime if you prefer
Cheers, Sergey

I have a test showing what I'd like to do, this test does not require any main code modifications. The use case is as follows. A JAX-RS service implementation exists, the response from this service needs to be processed by a Camel route and then returned back to the remote client. It is similar to a cxfbean example, where a Jetty endpoint is a consumer, cxfbean is a producer, except that in my test it is all done with a cxfrs only, no need to introduce another Camel component (camel-jetty). It is not a proxy example.

At this stage I'll be happy enough with only a test added so that we can possibly discuss further what can be optimized.

Can you give me a favor though and apply a patch to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-8212 first ? The test I've done is done on top of the patch I did for CXF-8212. A CXF-8212 patch is a safe patch that allows CXFRS Spring users avoid typing no-op JAX-RS impementations. 

Cheers, Sergey

I'm thinking a bit more about it, may be this test should not go yet into the test source because it is very ineffective to do it this way. This is what I've tested:

{code:xml}
<cxf:rsServer id=""rsServer3"" address=""http://localhost:${CXFTestSupport.port1}/CxfRsSpringConsumerTest3/"">
    <cxf:serviceBeans>
       <ref bean=""customerServiceBean""/>
    </cxf:serviceBeans>
  </cxf:rsServer>
  
  
  <bean id=""customerServiceBean"" class=""org.apache.camel.component.cxf.jaxrs.testbean.CustomerService""/>
{code}
and then

{code:java}
protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception {
        
        final Processor baseUriProcessor = new Processor() {
            public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
                exchange.getIn().setHeader(""CamelHttpBaseUri"", ""/CxfRsSpringConsumerTest3"");
            }  
        };
        return new RouteBuilder() {
            public void configure() {
                from(""cxfrs://bean://rsServer3"").process(baseUriProcessor)
                    .to(""cxfbean:customerServiceBean"");
            }
        };
    }
{code}

This actually works right now, the problem is the CXF server chain is run twice. The existing example where a Jetty consumer delegates to a cxfbean is more effective.
I'm still considering to attach this test as part of a patch but for a different issue (a JAX-RS out interceptor can initiate a route to process a response). For this issue I'd like to have something like 

{code:java}
protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception {
        
        final Processor customerProcessor = new Processor() {
            public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
                exchange.getIn().getBody(Customer.class).setId(999);
            }  
        };
        return new RouteBuilder() {
            public void configure() {
                from(""cxfrs://bean://rsServer3"").process(customerProcessor);
            }
        };
    }
{code}

but I'm not sure how viable it is; I'll experiment a bit later on
Thanks

That is a good point, I just copied and pasted a test fragment, it would be a test only, to confirm that the response was routed to some Camel route.
I think an existing jetty consumer to cxfbean approach works well, it effectively does what this JIRA is really about, but as I said I'm curious if it can be marginally optimized directly with CXFRS alone...Let me update priority to Minor for now, I'll experiment later on...

A CXF user has implemented a JAX-RS service, example, a CustomerService which queries or updates some database. The task is to migrate this service into Camel. 
Wriiting a Camel Processor to check the operation names, etc (typical CXFRS processing) while a service implementation already exists is not really acceptable.

Camel offers one solution, from:jetty to cxfbean:bean, however it is a migration effort on its own compared to simply converting the existing CXF jaxrs:server configuration with JAX-RS providers, interceptors, properties, etc into a cxfrs: schema and avoiding introducing a new HTTP aware component (jetty, etc) into a context.

The service invocation will be optional and hence this enhancement is completely safe as far as the typical CXFRS flow users are concerned.
CXFRS users will be able to work with the request properties as usual in custom processors (example, also post a request body to some JMS topic, etc), while having a portable JAX-RS service in place. The response body would also be available to the custom processors.

Cheers, Sergey

Willem, can you please review ? IMHO it is a simple, safe, but very useful improvement for CXFRS users

Its just that today nobody normally experience this situation as the out of the box generators makes unique ids. But if ppl use their own id generator they may do this wrong. And IMHO its better for Camel to detect this and fail sending the message which the end user can see asap.

But this causes excessive logging with the misleading message:



JSCH -> Permanently added 'X' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.




It is misleading because the addition is not permament. It repeats with every SFTP connection. It is logged as a WARN which creates unnecesary review and filtering when analyzing the log files.


Although it is possible to configure the SFTP endpoint to specify the location of the common known_hosts file location, this must be added to every SFTP endpoint deployed to a Camel engine. For example, in a Spring XML/DSL the additional option is:



knownHostsFile={{user.home}}/.ssh/known_hosts




FIX: Change the default to be the "".ssh/known_hosts"" file in the user's home path. In ScpOperations.java, the declaration becomes...

My interpretaion of the current default location is to write to a relative file system location in a folder named META-INF. Normally, META-INF is a read-only, classpath location (not a writable file system location, at runtime). In the proposal, would the current default be ELSE option? If so, the relative location would be the current working directory when the JVM started, right? That seems a bit arbitrary.

    This was fixed for ssh but not for sftp in CAMEL-8202
    
     * Updated sftp to use user's home .ssh/known_hosts file by default
     * 'Implemented' updateFileHeaders as log messages

However, I will have a look and check why it's not working if we don't cache the script...

If the cacheScript option is false (default setting), camel language just create a new scriptbuilder per exchange due to CAMEL-7143, as the scriptbuilder create a new script factory that could introduce the performance and concurrency issues. 

The patch of CAMEL-8188 addressed the issue of CAMEL-8201.

race-condition

It causes that sometimes (nondeterministically) body of a response message is changed to null. It can happen when JMS response is received very fast (we use in-memory ActiveMQ with VM transport and no persistence) under heavy load.


It looks that there is a problem in JmsProducer class in processInOut(exchange, callback) method.



    protected boolean processInOut(final Exchange exchange, final AsyncCallback callback) {
        …
        doSend(true, destinationName, destination, messageCreator, messageSentCallback);
        // after sending then set the OUT message id to the JMSMessageID so its identical
        setMessageId(exchange);
        // continue routing asynchronously (reply will be processed async when its received)
        return false;
    }

...
    protected void setMessageId(Exchange exchange) {
        if (exchange.hasOut()) {
            JmsMessage out = exchange.getOut(JmsMessage.class);
            try {
                if (out != null && out.getJmsMessage() != null) {
                    out.setMessageId(out.getJmsMessage().getJMSMessageID());
                }
            } catch (JMSException e) {
                LOG.warn(""Unable to retrieve JMSMessageID from outgoing JMS Message and set it into Camel's MessageId"", e);
            }
        }
    }




The problem is caused by invoking setMessageId(...) method after doSend(...). Method doSend(...) is sending JMS request message and causes that another thread is used to handle JMS reply message. This leads to a situation that 2 different threads can operate on the same exchange (which is not synchronized at all) at the same time:
1) original thread in which processInOut(...) method was called,
2) separate thread from JMS component for handling JMS response.


In our case there it was happening sometimes that setMessageId(...) was invoked at the same time as PipelineHelper.createNextMessage(exchange) method:



    public static Exchange createNextExchange(Exchange previousExchange) {
        Exchange answer = previousExchange;
        // now lets set the input of the next exchange to the output of the
        // previous message if it is not null
        if (answer.hasOut()) {
            answer.setIn(answer.getOut());
            answer.setOut(null);
        }
        return answer;
    }




It caused that body of response message was lost (set to null).


It looks for me that calling setMessageId(...) at the end of processInOut(...) method is redundant and this logic should be executed when JMS reply message is handled.


I've attached a patch where invokation of setMessageId(...) is removed.

I just checked the code history, the code that you removed was introduced since CAMEL-1689, and I found the out message message id is set in the ReplyManagerSupport.processReply() method which relates to CAMEL-6218.

It should be safe to remove the code to avoid the race condition (if the response message comes later, the removed the code does nothing as the out message is not set yet.)

To do this we need to


1)
Create a new Maven plugin at
https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/master/tooling/maven


which can be inspired by
https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/master/tooling/maven/camel-package-maven-plugin


2)
Run this plugin in camel-spring and camel-blueprint, so it can read the camel-spring.xsd, camel-blueprint.xsd file, and inject documentation.


3)
Parse the XSD maybe using SAX, and inject the documentation.


For each xs:element in the top of the schema file
http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring/camel-spring.xsd


Then use the name, eg (name=split)



<xs:element name=""split"" type=""tns:splitDefinition""/>




To find the split.json file in camel-core. Then the json file has the documentation for that type (including inherited types).


So for the split definition



<xs:complexType name=""splitDefinition"">
<xs:complexContent>
<xs:extension base=""tns:expressionNode"">
<xs:sequence/>
<xs:attribute name=""parallelProcessing"" type=""xs:boolean""/>
<xs:attribute name=""strategyRef"" type=""xs:string""/>
<xs:attribute name=""strategyMethodName"" type=""xs:string""/>
<xs:attribute name=""strategyMethodAllowNull"" type=""xs:boolean""/>
<xs:attribute name=""executorServiceRef"" type=""xs:string""/>
<xs:attribute name=""streaming"" type=""xs:boolean""/>
<xs:attribute name=""stopOnException"" type=""xs:boolean""/>
<xs:attribute name=""timeout"" type=""xs:long""/>
<xs:attribute name=""onPrepareRef"" type=""xs:string""/>
<xs:attribute name=""shareUnitOfWork"" type=""xs:boolean""/>
<xs:anyAttribute namespace=""##other"" processContents=""skip""/>
</xs:extension>
</xs:complexContent>
</xs:complexType>




We can find the description of these attributes, and elements from the json file.


For example for the streaming attribute we have



 ""streaming"": { ""kind"": ""attribute"": ""required"": ""false"", ""type"": ""boolean"", ""javaType"": ""java.lang.Boolean"", ""description"": ""The splitter should use streaming -- exchanges are being sent as the data for them becomes available. This improves throughput and memory usage but it has a drawback: - the sent exchanges will no longer contain the link org.apache.camel.ExchangeSPLIT_SIZE header property""




Then add the needed xs:annotation to document it. 
http://www.w3schools.com/schema/el_annotation.asp


Which should be



<xs:annotation>
  <xs:documentation xml:lang=""en"">
The splitter should use streaming -- exchanges are being sent as the data for them becomes available. This improves throughput and memory usage but it has a drawback: - the sent exchanges will no longer contain the link org.apache.camel.ExchangeSPLIT_SIZE header property  
  </xs:documentation>
</xs:annotation>




Notice that the xsd will become bigger due the verbosity of how to annotate xsd fields. 


Mind that sometimes there is not yet documentation, so check for not empty value.


To parse the json file, then use this class from camel-core



List<Map<String, String>> rows = JsonSchemaHelper.parseJsonSchema(""properties"", json, true);




Then you have a map with key/value for all those values.","nkukhar:1422833566:2015-02-02T07:32:46.089+0000:1422833566:2015-02-02T07:32:46.089+0000:Do you accept contribution on this task? It looks quite interesting, I can work on it.

Though we use the camel-catalog JAR which is built at the end, but you need to use camel-core as camel-catalog isnt built until the end.

But as some the json schema files are in sub packages, you will need to try to find it similar to the following code
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/impl/DefaultCamelContext.java#L1325

eg using those sub packages if the input stream is null. Then you will eventually find the file.

https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/tooling/maven/camel-package-maven-plugin/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/maven/packaging/PrepareCatalogMojo.java#L103

    [CAMEL-8197] Create Maven plugin to inject EIP documentation into the spring and blueprint XML DSL.

    This is the firs version of documentation enricher plugin. Currently it works preaty well and injects documentation to majority of XSD schema, but it still has room for improvements:
    1) It doesn't enrich documentation to base types. (i.e. if <xs:complexType> has some extension <xs:extension base=""tns:dataFormat""> then documentation for <> <xs:complexType name='dataFormat'> wont be added).
    2) It has no unit tests.

My investigation leads me to Tomcat connection pool implementation - it has problem with returing current connection from Statement object - instead of returning pool specific proxy it returns actual JDBC connection.


There is `statement.getConnection()` line in `org.apache.camel.component.jdbc.ResultSetIterator` so in my particular scenario things work like this:
1) Camel borrows connection from Tomcat pool
2) Camel leaves JDBC connection and ResultSet intact as we use StreamList mode of camel-jdbc component
3) Route processes resultset in streaming mode and completes successfully
4) Camel tries to close connection, but due to connection pool implementation issue it closes actual JDBC connection instead of returing it to the pool
5) Actual JDBC connection is closed an connection pool is unaware of this fact thinking it's still open and in use by application

When performing bulk updates one creates individual index requests and adds them to the bulk request. When creating an index request one can set the source document, id, etc. 


The current design of the camel-elasticsearch component controls the transformation and assembly of an input body (json string, byte[], xcontentfactory, map) to an index request. Thus, it is impossible to set the id on the index request that goes into a bulk action. The end result is that the id is set by the default behavior of the underlying elasticsearch-java client which generates a random identifier.  This is problematic in situations where control is needed over the id, e.g. for de-duplication purposes.


My proposal is to improve the design of the producer to allow for elasticsearch-java ActionRequest sub-classes in the message body so that upstream message processors can control the creation of those requests.


I've attached a patch and sent a pull request on github.

This standard is based on XML Signature and defines enhancements which are placed into the 'SignatureProperties' element of the XML Signature. You can find the latest version of the standard in  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts%5C101900_101999%5C101903%5C01.04.02_60%5Cts_101903v010402p.pdf.


The attached patch implements the form Basic Electronic Signature (XAdES-BES) and the form Explicit Policy based Electronic Signature  (XAdES-EPES) for the XML Signature signer endpoint. It supports all current versions of XAdES (1.4.2, 1.4.1, 1.3.2., 1.2.2, 1.1.1).


The implementation has the following limitations:



No support for 'QualifyingPropertiesReference' (see section 6.3.2 of spec).
No support for Transforms element contained in SignaturePolicyId element contained in SignaturePolicyIdentifier
No support of CounterSignature element
AllDataObjectsTimeStamp element is not supported
IndividualDataObjectsTimeStamp element is not supported



It is possible to overcome the limitations in a later improvement.


I can do the wiki-update.

                <!-- Load our routes defined in the Java DSL -->
                <camel:package>org.example.myapp</camel:package>
        </camel:camelContext>

and the RouteBuilder class is in package org.example.myapp

Is using org.apache.camel.spring.Main sufficient for property injection to work?

I already have that, these are in camelContext.xml too:

        <context:property-placeholder location=""file://${app.home}/config/app.properties"" />

        <bean id=""properties"" class=""org.apache.camel.component.properties.PropertiesComponent"">
                <property name=""location"" value=""file://${app.home}/config/app.properties""/>
        </bean>

The properties are working in the camelContext.xml using ${spring} notation and in the URIs in RouteBuilder.java using {{camel}} notication.

Only the injection is not working.
daniel.pocock:1423465057:2015-02-09T14:57:37.082+0000:1423465530:2015-02-09T15:05:30.016+0000:Just another observation on this for Camel 2.13 users and a workaround:

- if I instantiate the PropertiesComponent as a spring bean like this:

    <bean id=""properties"" class=""org.apache.camel.component.properties.PropertiesComponent"">
        <property name=""location"" 
       value=""file:${project.home}/properties""/>
    </bean>

then I have the NullPointerException problem and can't inject properties into my RouteBuilder.

If I instantiate the PropertiesComponent this way:

    <camelContext id=""camel"" ... >
        <propertyPlaceholder id=""properties"" 
            location=""file:${project.home}/properties""/>
        ....

then I can use the PropertyInject annotation without the NullPointerException.

I tried manually instantiating the RouteBuilder as a Spring bean and then putting a reference to it in my <camelContext/> but that didn't help resolve the issue.  I'm currently using the <package>org.example.project</package> element without <camelContext/> to automatically find and instantiate my RouteBuilder and as long as I set <propertyPlaceholder/> it seems OK.

The issue is Mina2Consumer:160, it is setting UseClientMode to true, it should be false. Mina2Producer line 313 needs to also change to the following:
            SslFilter filter = new SslFilter(configuration.getSslContextParameters().createSSLContext(), configuration.isAutoStartTls());
filter.setUseClientMode(true);

I just run the mvn camel:run inside of camel-example-sql-blueprint, I cannot reproduce the error that you hit.
Can you run  ""mvn clean install -Dtest=false"" to build the Camel-2.15-SNAPSHOT first?

This parameter needs to be set to false when the end-of-frame delimiter is part of the message (e.g., the closing tag of an XML document), and therefore must not be discarded.


Suggested fix:



Add a new constructor to DatagramPacketDelimiterDecoder that includes the parameter, which is then passed through to the delegate DelimiterBasedFrameDecoder
Add a new method signature for ChannelHandlerFactories.newDelimiterBasedFrameDecoder that includes the parameter

The problem with that is, that the usage of this feature overwrites the current Locale setting of the environment. For example, if the current Locale was set to ""German"" and the provided pattern for the BigDecimal field requires ""US"" to unmarshal the numbers in the CSV file, then the method BigDecimalPatternFormat#parse(String) overwrites the Locale, but doesn't restore the former setting. This can cause problems for other software components that depends on the Locale setting.


The cause of the problem can be found here on line 21: Source of BigDecimalPatternFormat


A possible workaround would be storing the current locale temporarily, overwrite that setting, perform the formatting task and then restore the former locale setting.
Like in this code example:



if (getNumberFormat() != null) {
    final Locale currentLocale = Locale.getDefault();
    Locale.setDefault(super.getLocale());
    DecimalFormat df = (DecimalFormat)getNumberFormat();
    df.setParseBigDecimal(true);
    BigDecimal bd = (BigDecimal)df.parse(string.trim());
    if(super.getPrecision() != -1) {
        bd = bd.setScale(super.getPrecision(), RoundingMode.valueOf(super.getRounding()));
    }
    Locale.getDefault(); // what is the purpose of this line?
    Locale.setDefault(currentLocale); // restore the Locale setting
    return bd;

The attached patch improves the behavior in a backwards-compatible way.



HL7MLLPCodec has a new property named ""produceString"" (default true). If set to false, the codec sends a byte array into the route instead of a string. In this case, no charset is evaluated yet.
the HL7DataFormat checks the field MSH-18 for the charset to be used for marshalling and unmarshalling. If MSH-18 is empty,  it uses the standard Camel charset properties/headers by default. If MSH-18 was populated, the value is copied to a new message header ""CamelHL7Charset""

route.getId() returns null when the context has not started.

{noformat}
public synchronized RouteDefinition getRouteDefinition(String id) {
    for (RouteDefinition route : routeDefinitions) {
        if (route.getId().equals(id)) {
            return route;
        }
    }
    return null;
}
{noformat}

There was a time when I could get one route via getRouteDefinition by id successfully but not another. getRouteDefinition(A) = successful but getRouteDefinition(B) = exception. The difference is that route B is declared in camel-context.xml after route A.

However, after adding <import> and <routeContextRef>, getRouteDefinition(A) failed too. The route I'm trying to grab is in the main context file, not in the imported one.

It appears that camel-context.xml is loaded in a background thread and has a race condition with my methods. I have the same problem with @Test methods. I tried sleeping for, say, a minute in @Begin but that doesn't fix the problem. I also moved the @Begin code to the @Test method and put a sleep there. That doesn't work either. The only fix is to call context.start().

In camel-context.xml most routes do not specify an id attribute.

One of the endpoints triggers a bindy action to read records from a fixed-length-record input file. For this purpose we are using camel bindy.


I this conjuction we discovered that there is an issue when trying to locate those classes which are annotated with @FixedLengthRecord since the are located in a JAR-File.


The project structure looks like this:



project-ear
	
project-war
		
WEB-INF/lib/project-jar







If we locate the classes directly at WEB-INF/classes/my/package camel is able to discover the annotated classes.


After some debugging we have found out, that DefaultPackageScanClassResolver is trying to open an InputStream like this:


/opt/jboss-eap/current/standalone/deployments/bindy-ear.ear/bindy-ws-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war/WEB-INF/lib/bindy-core-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar/my/package/

""From Camel 2.8 onwards there is no longer the need for using this camel-jboss component as Camel is now capable of loading type converters without package scanning.

See more details at Type Converter.
One exception is if you are using Bindy component as it still needs this JBoss resolver.""

/opt/jboss-eap/current/standalone/deployments/bindy-ear.ear/bindy-ws-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war/WEB-INF/lib/
{code}

And in that lib directory there is the JAR files (but they are not expanded) ?

If so the trick would be to know this from the url above which is just a string. And then add some logic that tries to list the dir for .jar files and then use a jar url loader to scan inside those JARs. All extra work needed to do so, which with some hard-work may be possible to add in camel-core.

You can welcome to experiment with this as you got an EAP app server on your system and use bindy.

Having such a thing prebuild into camel would make things like, reading from a file or report generator and send this to one or more mail accounts attaching it to mail (e.g. billing to customer) much more easy and understandable instead of forching one to write custom code.

        from(MyRouteBuilder.ENTRY_ENDPOINT)
            .routeId(""some.route"")
            .process(doSomething())
            .to(MyRouteBuilder.EXIT_ENDPOINT);




Where ENTRY_ENDPOINT = ""entry.endpoint.uri""
and EXIT_ENDPOINT = ""exit.endpoint.uri""


Then, in production, the Camel context is initialized with a properties file where the URIs use the ""jms"" component, while in our unit tests we initialise the context with a 'test' properties file where the URIs use the ""direct"" component. For example:



# test.properties
entry.endpoint.uri = direct:myRouteBuilder.entry
exit.endpoint.uri = direct:myRouteBuilder.exit




A typical RouteBuilder unit test looks something like this:



@RunWith(CamelSpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(
        classes = { MyRouteBuilderTest.TestConfig.class },
        loader = CamelSpringDelegatingTestContextLoader.class
)
@MockEndpointsAndSkip(value =  ""direct:myRouteBuilder.exit"")
public class MyRouteBuilderTest {

    @Produce(uri = MyRouteBuilder.ENTRY_ENDPOINT)
    private ProducerTemplate myRouteBuilderProducer;

    @EndpointInject(uri = ""mock:"" + MyRouteBuilder.EXIT_ENDPOINT)
    private MockEndpoint mockOutputServiceEndpoint;

    @Autowired
    private CamelContext camelContext;

    @Test
    public void testSomething() {
        ....
    }

    @Configuration
    public static class TestConfig extends SingleRouteCamelConfiguration {
        @Override
        protected void setupCamelContext(CamelContext camelContext) throws Exception {
            super.setupCamelContext(camelContext);
            PropertiesComponent prop = camelContext.getComponent(""properties"", PropertiesComponent.class);
            prop.setLocation(""myRouteBuilder.test.properties"");
        }

        @Override
        public RouteBuilder route() {
            return new MyRouteBuilder();
        }
    }




The issue we're having is that the @MockEndpointsAndSkip annotation on the test class does not resolve property placeholders, therefore we have to write the resolved value instead of the property placeholder value (which is a public static variable in the RouteBuilder implementation) I.e. we want to use MyRouteBuilder.EXIT_ENDPOINT instead of ""direct:myRouteBuilder.exit"".


It would be nicer to avoid having duplicate extra hard-coded Strings if possible, so that if the endpoint uri value is updated in the property file then all the tests don't also have to be updated.","njiang:1416769217:2014-11-24T03:00:17.797+0000:1416769217:2014-11-24T03:00:17.797+0000:Applied the patch into camel master, camel-2.14.x and camel-2.13.x branches.

If no tail tracking object exists in the database, a new one will be inserted (that's okay), but the query ""dbCol.findOne()"" fetches ANY tail tracking object from the database (and not the one we've just inserted). 


In my oppinition, this is a bug and should be corrected like this: 
...
DBObject filter = new BasicDBObject(""persistentId"", config.persistentId);
trackingObj = dbCol.findOne(filter);
 if (trackingObj == null) 

{
            dbCol.insert(filter, WriteConcern.SAFE);

A workaround can be implemented by putting each persistent tail tracker in it's own collection, so I marked this issue as ""minor"".

This change is really focused around the use case of a jpa consumer and the JpaTransactionManager (if using a JtaTransactionManager it may have an affect, depending on whether it's using CMP or not.

If a component is missing then there are two cases:



blueprint : The user bundle goes into graceperiod status and waits for the component to come up. In case the component is still missing there is a failure.
In other cases: Camel will simply display and error about the missing component.



The proper OSGi way to handle camel components would be to use capabilities and requirements. 
See
http://wiki.osgi.org/wiki/Provide-Capability
http://wiki.osgi.org/wiki/Require-Capability


So a bundle offering a component should have a capability to express that as well as the user bundle should have a requirement for the capability.


This will even allow a suitable OSGi resolver to auto install bundles that match the required capabilties. In any case it will make sure the required components are installed before the user bundle starts. 


So to support this the first decision is how to name the capability.
I propose: ""org.apache.camel.component"".


Then we have to decide how we name the components. I propose we use the component prefix. E.g ""file"" for the file component.


The next thing is to add the Provide-Capability headers to the components. This has to be done before the users start creating Require-Capability headers. 


To automate this step I propose to create a maven plugin that scans for META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/component/* files and creates suitable headers.",

Since Camel 2.11.2, The cxfClientCallBack doesn't seem to be honouring the exception that it is passed in.

 finally {
            // copy 


2.11.2
  public void handleException(Map<String, Object> ctx, Throwable ex) {
        try {
            super.handleException(ctx, ex);
            // need to call the conduitSelector complete method to enable the fail over feature
            ConduitSelector conduitSelector = cxfExchange.get(ConduitSelector.class);
            if (conduitSelector != null) {
                conduitSelector.complete(cxfExchange);
                ex = cxfExchange.getOutMessage().getContent(Exception.class);

        } finally {


So for our testcase where we have a cxf client calling through camel to a Corba web service, the exception that the webservice is passing back to camel is no longer honoured.


I believe this change was introduced by the following jira:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-6609


I have attached the wsdl of the corba web-service.
In the service we are calling PingMe expecting to get back a PingMeFault_Exception. The exception is set in the cxf corba binding and reached the exception handler in camel. But the exception is no longer being sent back to the client. Instead a generic SoapFaultException is reaching the client.

Prior to 2.11.1 the User exception thrown in the PingMe() method, was being propagated back into the client side, since then that exception type gets lost and the generic SOAPFault is seen instead.

Here's a patch that's the starting of a fix for things here, it's just a workaround for the CORBA things for now.

There is probably bug in camel hdfs2 consumer.


In this project are two camel routes, one taking files from `test-source` and uploading them to hadoop hdfs,
another route watching folder in hadoop hdfs and downloading them to `test-dest` folder in this project.


It seems, that when downloading file from hdfs to local filesystem, it keeps writing chunks of data to begining of target file in test-source, instead of simply appending chunks, as I would expect.
From camel log i suppose, that each chunk of data from hadoop file is treated it was whole file.


Ruby script `generate_textfile.rb` can generate file `test.txt` with content 



0 - line
1 - line
2 - line
3 - line
4 - line
5 - line
...
...
99999 - line




Scenario



expecting running hadoop instance on localhost:8020
run mvn camel:run
copy test.txt into test-source
see log and file test.txt in test-dest
rest.txt in test-dest folder should contain only last x lines of original one.



Camel log

Envoriment



camel 2.14 and 2.13
hadoop VirtualBox VM
* downloaded from http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/downloads/quickstart_vms/cdh-5-2-x.html
* tested with version 2.3.0-cdh5.1.0, r8e266e052e423af592871e2dfe09d54c03f6a0e8 which I couldn't find on download page
hadoop docker image
* https://github.com/sequenceiq/hadoop-docker
* results were the same as with virtualbox vm



In case ov VirtualBox VM, by default it binds hdfs to `hdfs://quickstart.cloudera:8020` and it needs to be changed in `/etc/hadoop/conf/core-site.xml`. It should work when `fs.defaultFS` is set to `hdfs://0.0.0.0:8020`.


In case of docker hadoop image, first start docker container, figure out its ip address, and use it for camel hdfs component.
Here camel uri would be `hdfs:172.17.0.2:9000/tmp/camel-test`.



 
docker run -i -t sequenceiq/hadoop-docker:2.5.1 /etc/bootstrap.sh -bash

see to which IP hdfs filesystem api is bound to inside docker container

There might be Exception because of hdfs permissions. It could be solved by setting hdfs filesystem permissions.

I just checked your camel route,  your file endpoint is using the default setting of fileExist which is override the file. That could explain why camel keeps write new chunck to the same file. 
You can get it work by changing the route just like this:
{code}
       <camel:route id=""toFile"" autoStartup=""true"">
            <from uri=""hdfs2:localhost:8020/tmp/camel-test/""/>
            <log message=""picked up file from hdfs with name $simple{header.CamelFileName}""/>
            <to uri=""file:test-dest?fileExist=Append""/>
            <log message=""file downloaded from hadoop""/>
        </camel:route>
{code}

Please check out this [page|https://camel.apache.org/file2] for more information.

yeah, but the docs says that ""Override, which is the default, replaces the existing *file*.""
But from what I see, it is replacing *chunks of that file* so in the end, I don't even have valid file, just last data chunk of original file from hadoop.
If it was picture, it would be corrupted.

It looks like camel handles data chunk (with size of bufferSize - default 4096) as it was the whole file.

I double check the camel route that you have, you are using the default setting of hdfs and file endpoints. Unfortunately, the default setting of file endpoint is not work as you expected.
 
If you take a look at the [HDFS2|https://camel.apache.org/hdfs2], you can find the chunkSize option is for ""When reading a normal file, this is split into chunks producing a message per chunk."" As the file endpoint is in Override mode, it just treat the new trunk block in the message body as a new file body, so it keep override it. If you want to get the whole file, you need to setup the file endpoint fileExist option to Append.

It checks if GSM 3.38 can represent all the characters in the message and if not it just uses UCS2 (UTF-16).


This is less than optimal.  Many messages using European languages can not be encoded in GSM 3.38 but they can be coded in Latin1, which is also supported by SMPP (data_coding / alphabet numeric code for Latin1 is 3)


The jSMPP library (Alphabet.java) does not currently know about the alphabet code 3.


I proposed a patch for jSMPP and if it is accepted then camel-smpp should be updated to use it.  I already started writing a patch against camel-smpp.  Here is the jSMPP patch:

The DefaultCamelContextRegistry implementation gives package protected access to add/remove camel contexts to the camel runtime. Clients are not expected to manage the set of registered contexts.

Registered listeners are owned by the client which registered the listener.
Neither the camel runtime nor non-owning clients can control the set of registered listeners. 

Adding a public DefaultCamelContextRegistry.clear() method would break this contract.

Results :

Failed tests:
  CamelContextRegistryTest.testContainerSet:57 expected:<2> but was:<107>

Though that smells the registry leaks during testing, and its likely better to turn the registry off by default, and if ppl want to use it they need to enable it explict.

I fear that it can lead to class loader leaks and whatnot for people in environments where they depeploy apps and whatnot.

AFAICS, a CamelContext is owned by the client that creates it. The client therefore also controls the (softly defined) identity and the sharing. The context ends life when the client does no longer hold a reference to it. A call to CamelContext.stop() is optional.

We are now trying to introduce an entity that has a lifecycle that outlives individual contexts and (although it does not own them) holds references to them. To model this properly, we would probably want to have something like a CamelRuntime - similar to Framework and Bundle in OSGi. The runtime is the owner of all contexts, it provides a view of all registered contexts, it can be queried and possibly own other constructs that are applicable to multiple contexts (i.e. defaults for newly created contexts). This would be a larger change to camel and probably requires a lot more thought.

CamelContextRegistry.clear() is still wrong, but it is also wrong to assume that a context gets an non-optional call to CamelContext.stop() which ends its life. 

The registry probably needs to hold weak references, to avoid hogging of stale contexts.
tdiesler:1416282854:2014-11-18T11:54:14.660+0000:1416282854:2014-11-18T11:54:14.660+0000:Closing as won't fix and removing what has been done already. 

If there is no defined create/destroy lifecycle for the CamelContext the system cannot reliably maintain the set of contexts.

As mentioned before, it is incorrect to call into 3rd party code with a partially constructed object. There is also no defined integration point to remove a context from a potential registry.

If a higher level API needs a context registry it should maintain it itself. The camel core layer should only need to provide an integration hook but no registry itself.

The existing Container API (among other flaws) also has a memory leak. Contexts that are created but never stopped will not get removed from the internal set when no Container is registered.

Though there is currently a few shortcomings that can be improved



the component json schema is currently runtime generated, which requires to load the component and create an instance of it. Instead we should build-time generate it, which we do today with the camel apt compiler plugin. DONE




we should include documentation about the option from the javadoc, that allows end users to fully document a component using plain java getter/settr with javadocs, and add those @UriParam annotations for the apt compiler to detect and leverage DONE




add a module that embeds all these json schema files in a single module, and also other information, such as the xml schemas, and what else can be handy. Then there is a single module as a one stop shop for tooling and whatnot to gather information about a Camel release. There is a new camel-catalog module that contains this now. DONE




allow at runtime to explain an endpoint uri what the options in use are, eg as we got the json schema, we can add mbeans that can explain those options, than we can use in tooling, JMX, karaf commands etc. And also IDE editors etc DONE




add JMX/Java API to explain a EIP and also get a tabular data with a list of all EIPs and their data. DONE




enrich the dsl xml to inject javadoc for the eips into the xml schema, so we have documented in the xsd directly that any tooling can use. We have a old ticket about this. But the apt compiler plugin can detect the @JAXB annotations in the model and extract the javadoc, and generate a json schema with, and then we can load those and enrich into the generated xsd, or enrich into the jaxb model generator, or something.




migrate more Camel components to include javadoc as documentation for their options DONE for all camel-core. Other components will be migrated over time.




figure out how to specify a default value in the json schema. Unfortunately the apt plugin cannot grab that from the source code. So the only solution I can think of now is to add an attribute to the @UriParam where you can specify that, eg this is also what I have seen others do. There is now a defaultValue attribute on UriParam to be used. DONE




add component summary to component json file so we have a description of what the component does DONE




add attribute to @UriEndpoint to link it to the component class, so we can include the class name of the component in the json schema, which allows Camel to link from component class -> schema. eg the point is that if people define a component as ""activemq"" we do not know its the jms schema that has its documentation. Though we can infer this by the component class name. And alternative is for a component to have an api to return its original schema name etc. So activemq can say ""jms"" etc. We can resolve this by iterating the component data, and find the FQN of the components. DONE




add @UriComponent annotation to component class which allows end users to provide meta-data about the component. Currently we grab a summary of what the component does from the maven pom.xml. Though this annotation prepares us for being able to scan the component class as well for which option it provides, so we can have out of the box documentation for that also. We detect getter/setter pairs as component options, and the apt plugin generates those in the schema. Use @Metadata to configure the options. DONE




add JMX/Java API to explain a component and also get a tabular data with a list of all components and that data. DONE




improve karaf commands to use the component information to show that also DONE




add name of karaf feature of the component, eg its 99% came-xxx, but there may be some exceptions. We can likely add a property to the maven plugin that generates component.properties to include the karaf feature name as the artifactId by default. But allow to set a property in the pom.xml in case there is another name, or no karaf feature




add support for @UriPath in apt plugin DONE




javadoc documentation is not acessible from components which extend other components (eg javadoc from source code of parent components). For example camel-ftp extending file in camel-core etc. Added description to @UriParam to be used for this purpose. DONE




add support for associating label(s) to a endpoint so we can group the various Camel components. A bit like this page: http://camel.apache.org/component-list-grouped.html DONE




rename @Label to something more generic like @Metadata or something, so we can introduce new attributes for new stuff. For example a link which refers to the project website, or an icon to refer to an icon that symbol the component, etc. DONE




we now support components + eip with json schema and documentation and jmx + commands out of the box. We should look into adding the same for languages and data formats. Then we have all of them covered.DONE","davsclaus:1415767120:2014-11-12T12:38:40.383+0000:1415767120:2014-11-12T12:38:40.383+0000:The @UriPath is now included in the list of options.

You can submit another pull request for the binding issue.
I'm in the middle of merge the patch to camel-netty, I will take a look the issue once I finished the merge.

The second commit is in the same pull request. Is that right or wrong? Github did this automatically. Or should i wait for integration and after that reopen a complete new pull request? Sorry for asking again and again. It is the first time for me working this way.

There is a few things to work on

- archetype should use vanilla Apache Camel / Karaf (eg remove jboss fuse)
- the sample route should likely be simpler, to have a basic project setup
- camel-scr should be and osgi bundle, and not embedded from end user applications - I partly fixed that
- there is a camel-scr feature to install this, which you would need to do
- would be nice with an example in examples/camel-example-scr that is easily to install and try for end users
- review of the code in camel-scr. I suspect there is something to improve
- documentation

And the route model gets updated with the resolved values, eg so {{ }} gets replaced with the value.


So when you dump the route model as xml (eg as source) then you loose the {{ }} placeholders and see the actual values.


We should allow to keep the {{ }} so the route model is 100% as designed, but we should also store the resolved values that the runtime route is using, so you can see those values as well.","davsclaus:1415062028:2014-11-04T08:47:08.247+0000:1415062028:2014-11-04T08:47:08.247+0000:For example you may develop this route

Maybe processor definition could keep a copy if itself from the moment it was created (something like instance→template relationship)?

Also there's inconsistency: {{ProcessorDefinition}} instances have their placeholder values replaced with actual values when the {{Processor}} is created. But this is not the case for {{FromDefinition}} which only provides it's (probably parameterized with placeholder) value of {{uri}} in {{org.apache.camel.model.FromDefinition#resolveEndpoint()}}."

This is because the JmsProducer, by default, pre-populates sessions+producers on Producer.doStart(), which is called by the CamelContext in a single thread and the way the ConnectionFactoryResource is configured, it returns the most recently idle connection (So really it always returns the first connection opened). So all sessions being pre-populated by all SJMS endpoints always use the same single connection.


This patch attached makes the ConnectionFactoryResource effectively return connections in a round-robbin manor. Unit test is included.


This is important because TCP has a certain overhead per socket which makes it impossible to achieve much more than 6k~ messages a second, regardless of the CPU and IO resources available to a broker. To fully utilize a broker multiple connections must be opened.


This is also important if your ConnectionFactory represent a cluster (Like in the case of HornetQ), where subsequent connections from the factory are balanced across nodes in the cluster.",njiang:1415041583:2014-11-04T03:06:23.491+0000:1415041583:2014-11-04T03:06:23.491+0000:Applied the patch into camel master branch with thanks to Aaron.

This seems to cause some routes to be missed.


Route definitions:



 from(""direct:start1"")
     .routeId(""route1"")
     .log(""route1: ${body}"");

 from(""direct:start2"")
      .routeId(""route2"")

Testing:



 ProducerTemplate template = context.createProducerTemplate();
 template.sendBody(""direct:start1"", ""World!"");
 template.sendBody(""direct:start2"", ""World!"");




This leads to following exception:

If the direct:start3 route is deleted or the ID ""route1"" is renamed, then everything works as expected.

And you get these NPEs.


Maybe something needs to be fixed in camel-test-blueprint with that pojosr library, so bundle 0 is that system bundle, as the NPE is at:

Or can reach out to that community to get a new pojosr release with this fix. Another way is to add a workaroud in felix fileinstall to avoid that repearted logging, which does CPU spike. eg when there is an exception the loop does not sleep for 1 sec which it otherwise does by default, causing CPU spikes.

To reproduce the error, it's enough to add a .threads(1) before the mock processor in the CircuitBreakerLoadBalancerTest routeBuilder configuration.


This misbehaviour seems to be related to the use of the AsyncProcessorConverterHelper to force any processor to behave like asynchronous. 


I'm going to propose a patch with the failing test and a proposal of solution.


EDIT:


the patch contains the fix also to other unexpected behaviour of the CircuitBreaker.


The second problem addressed is that, after the opening of the circuit, the RejectedExecutionException raised by the circuit breaker is set in the Exchange, but it doesn't return. This cause the processor will receive the Exchange even if the circuit is open. In this case also, if the CircuitBreaker is instructed to react only to specific Exception, it will close the circuit after the following request, because the raised exception would be a RejectedExecutionException instead of the one specified in the configuration.","Matteo Pavesi:1414397436:2014-10-27T16:10:36.536+0000:1414397450:2014-10-27T16:10:50.533+0000:Added patches (based on branch 2.14.x) containing failing test and proposed solution.

That may need a bit more logic to implement correctly, as you may need to add logic in the callback to do after work in the circuit breaker. I have not yet taken a closer look, but just beware more work is likely needed to fix this properly.

This configuration results in the following template string (NettyHttpComponent.java line 279):

The main problem is the hash mark encoded as ""%23"" and interpreted by the string formatter. Also, the second '?' in the URL probably should be a '&'.

The Container singleton is however called from the DefaultCamelContext ctor (i.e. before the name is initialised properly)

Currently Spring Boot Camel doesn't support Camel annotations like {{@EndpointInject}} or {{@MockEndpoints}}. I decided not to add them in the first version of the camel-spring-boot because Spring Boot test support is flexible enough to handle the majority of the test cases. For example you can define your route using Spring property:

{code}
@Value(""${from:jms:queue}"")
String from;

from(""{{from}}"").to(...);
{code}

And then override it in the Spring Boot test:

{code}
@IntegrationTest(""from=mock:test"")
{code}

Actually this approach is ever better because you can override part of the routes using system/environment properties, which is extremely useful when working with the Dockerized Camel applications for example.

However I agree that supporting Camel annotations is still a good idea. I will add this soon.

Cheers.

@IntegrationTest

        producerTemplate.sendBody(""direct:test"", ""msg"");

==== Claus: ====

This is not as correct as autoStartup is already defined in the Java
DSL at route definition. We should not add it to processor defintion
as then its too verbose in the DSL, as it becomes visible where it
makes no sense, eg from X to Y to Z ... autoStartup...

So remove it from processor definition and find another way to add it
to the Scala DSL.

And btw this is also wrong

   public Type autoStartup(String autoStartup) {
+        return autoStartup(Boolean.valueOf(autoStartup));
+    }

That should use Camels property placeholder as the string is intended
as a placeholder key etc.

The root cause seems to be that the service name from the generated service class differs from the service name in the WSDL.


For me it is unclear if this should be an issue with the cxf-codegen-plugin or with the Camel CXF component. When running the CXF client without Camel then the soapAction HTTP header is correctly set and the issue does not occur. So that's why I first report the bug with Camel.


Possible workarounds I found are:
1) Explicitly specifying the correct serviceName as CXF endpoint attribute.
2) Explicitly setting the soapAction header in the Camel route prior to calling the CXF endpoint.


Both workarounds are not desirable, because they are easily forgotten and CXF does not throw an exception when you do. According to the basic profile v1.0 the soapAction HTTP header must match the value in the WSDL and receiving SOAP servers may throw a SOAP Fault if it doesn't. Some SOAP servers do throw an exception when the soapAction HTTP header is invalid. Resulting in communication failures between some SOAP client/server combinations.


I created a test project to verify the above behaviour with the following tests:
1) CXF in PAYLOAD with Camel. => OK
2) CXF in POJO mode without Camel => OK
3) CXF in POJO mode with Camel => NOT OK
4) CXF in POJO mode with service name set => OK
5) CXF in POJO mode with soapAction set => OK


I run the test project with multiple combinations of Camel and CXF. The following combinations I have tried:
1) Camel 2.12.3 and CXF 2.7.10 (Apache Servicemix 5.0.0 setup)
2) Camel 2.12.4 and CXF 2.7.11 (Apache Servicemix 5.0.5 setup)
3) Camel 2.13.2 and CXF 2.7.11 (Apache Servicemix 5.1.3 and 5.3.0 setup)
4) Camel 2.14.0 and CXF 3.0.1


In the example project the mismatch occurs between an annotation in the generated service class:



@WebService(targetNamespace = ""http://finalist.nl/ai/"", name = ""ICamelCxfTestService"")




and the definition of the service name in the WSDL:



<wsdl:service name=""CamelCxfTestService"">","tonswieb:1413461317:2014-10-16T20:08:37.906+0000:1413461317:2014-10-16T20:08:37.906+0000:It looks like the parameter wsdlURL is causing the problem.

When using the parameter wsdlURL in the CXF endpoint URI the soapAction is not set:
cxf:http://localhost:8080?&serviceClass=nl.finalist.ai.ICamelCxfTestService&wsdlURL=CamelCxfTestService.wsdl

When leaving it out the soapAction is correctly set:

Somehow, when the endpoint is configured over its URL with both WSDL and SEI set as in your POJO case, the action value is not correctly extracted. So, you will get the same problem when you add WSDL in your PAYLOAD case and you won't get the problem when you remove either WSDL or SEI from your POJO case.

Does someone have a quick idea?

{code}
@WebService(targetNamespace = ""http://finalist.nl/ai/"", name = ""ICamelCxfTestService"")
{code}
is expected behavior, the @WebService annotation has another attribute serviceName which should be equal with wsdl:service@name, the attribute serviceName normally should be in the impl class.

However for the cxf:producer endpoint the serviceClass specified must be an interface so that there's no serviceName attribute in the @WebService annotation at all.  And the current logic is that if can't find the serviceName, use the convention that the SEI classname + ""Service"", as the SEI classname is same as the wsdl:portType@name from the wsdl, so in your wsdl the wsdl:service name should be wsdl:portType name + ""Service"". Otherwise you really need specify the serviceName in the cxf:producer endpoint URI.

Thanks for looking into this.

Beside from any WSDL conventions I believe the WSDL is valid and is WS-I compliant. When using a valid WSDL I would expect one of the following:
* A valid SOAP implementation is generated.
* An excpetion is thrown stating that a SOAP implementation cannot be generated due to missing properties.

Generating a SOAP implementation which is relying on naming conventions in the WSDL does not sounds like a very good plan to me. It would require me to either always set the servicename attribute explicitly to be on the safe side or modify the WSDL to adhere to the naming convention. In case of a missing servicename I think it would be better for the Camel Producer to fail fast instead of trying to make the best of it.

<camelContext xmlns=""http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint"">
  <route id=""testServiceRoute"">
      <from uri=""cxf:bean:testServiceEndpoint""/>
      <log message=""Incoming Body:  ${body}""/>

      <convertBodyTo type=""com.test.testservice.TestMessageResponse""/>
      <log message=""Response Body after convert:  ${body}""/>
  </route>
</camelContext>




And the camel-cxf consumer endpoint:



<cxf:cxfEndpoint id=""testServiceEndpoint""
                 address=""/TestService/v1""
                 wsdlURL=""wsdl/TestService.wsdl""
                 serviceName=""s:TestServiceInterface""
                 endpointName=""s:TestServicePort""

        <cxf:properties>
          <entry key=""dataFormat"" value=""PAYLOAD""/>
        </cxf:properties>
</cxf:cxfEndpoint>




I have explicitly set ""dataFormat"" to default PAYLOAD just for clarity purpose.


In this simple camel route, I try to change the entire body to a String XML message. As a result, the client will get an empty response back (I mean an empty soap envelope). The reason is due to following method:
org.apache.camel.component.cxf.DefaultCxfBinding.getBodyFromCamel:



public static Object getBodyFromCamel(org.apache.camel.Message out,
            DataFormat dataFormat) {
        Object answer = null;
        
        if (dataFormat == DataFormat.POJO) {
            answer = out.getBody();
        } else if (dataFormat == DataFormat.PAYLOAD) {
            answer = out.getBody(CxfPayload.class);
        } else if (dataFormat.dealias() == DataFormat.RAW) {
            answer = out.getBody(InputStream.class);
        } else if (dataFormat.dealias() == DataFormat.CXF_MESSAGE) {
            answer = out.getBody();
        }
        return answer;
    }




Obviously it will return a null object back because it tries to get a body of CxfPayload type. And I also know that above camel route will work fine if I use MESSAGE dataFormat instead.


However, the strange behaviour aries if I refresh camel-jaxb bundle in Karaf container. The client will get a non-empty response from OKResponse.xml file and everything works fine now. It looks like that when I refreshed camel-jaxb bundle, camel-core's FallbackConverter kicked in and it helped CXF consumer to convert the payload object into POJO.


If I refreshed camel-core bundle, then above test case would stop working and client would get an empty response (empty soap envelope) back, again. So it looks like that when camel-core bundle's was refreshed, it's new activator was not able to load converters from camel-jaxb bundle since the bundle was already there. So only refreshing of the camel-jaxb bundle would enable camel-core to load the FallbackConverter again, thus helps the test route to work. 


I also tried to change ""start-level"" of the camel-jaxb bundle to a value much higher than '50', say '80', then it would work the most times.","joeluo:1413422416:2014-10-16T09:20:16.905+0000:1413422416:2014-10-16T09:20:16.905+0000:The test case can be downloaded from this JIRA:

{quote}
Changes to JmsObjectFactory

Methods that were deleted, because they were directly replaced by DestinationCreationStrategy
- createDestination()
- createQueue()
- createTemporaryDestination()
- createTopic()

Methods that were deleted, because they took a Session to create a Destination and then went on to call createMessageConsumer() with said Destination. Since DestinationCreationStrategy replaces all creation of Destinations these methods were no longer needed.
- createQueueConsumer()
- createTopicConsumer()
- createTemporaryMessageConsumer()

Methods that were not used anywhere in the code base. I could put these back if really needed, but since no one was using them I figured it's cleaner to not have them, after all they are there in the version control history.
- createQueueProducer()
- createTopicProducer()

Methods changed to accept a Destination instead of a String destination, and the logic of Destination creation was moved out into DestinationCreationStrategy.
- createMessageConsumer()
- createMessageProducer()


Changes to InOnlyProducer.doCreateProducerModel()
- Corrected usage of try {} finally {} block. Also simplies the code, no need for null check anymore.
- replaced 'if (isEndpointTransacted())' and 'if (getCommitStrategy() != null)' with ternary operators, to provide cleaner code.
- Added call to DestinationCreationStrategy to create the Destination before calling JmsObjectFactory.createMessageProducer.
- Better to fail hard, don't return a null resource, error out instead. Exception will propagate back up to SjmsProducer.doStart().


Changes to InOutProducer

Changes to doCreateProducerModel()
- Corrected usage of try {} finally {} block. Also simplies the code, no need for null check anymore.
- replaced 'if (isEndpointTransacted())' with ternary operator, for cleaner code.
- Added call to DestinationCreationStrategy to create the Destination before calling JmsObjectFactory.createMessageProducer.
- removed null checks, because 1) JMS specification says that connection.createSession() will return a non null value or throw an exception. 2) provide consistency with InOnlyProducer.
- Better to fail hard, don't return a null resource, error out instead. Exception will propagate back up to SjmsProducer.doStart().

Changes to sendMessage()
- Corrected usage of try {} finally {} block and Lock, reference http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html

Changes to MessageConsumerResourcesFactory.makeObject()
- Corrected usage of try {} finally {} block with borrowConnection().
- No default NULL value for the 'answer' variable, as the method should either throw an exception or return non-null.

Removed inner class InternalTempDestinationListener
- Not used anywhere. Cleaner code, history will be in version control..

Thanks for the comments, it's very helpful when I went through the patch. 
As you introduced a new DestinationCreationStrategy and did lots of clean up work (removing the unused code), I'm afraid I cannot merge the patch into camel-2.14.x branch.

BTW, I just updated the sjms wiki page with this new Option of DestinationCreateionStrategy. Please double check the page in case I missed something.

In a current scenario I want to use camel to loosely couple two components using direct endpoints that might be consumed by some bean. Especially there should be no dependency from the producing component to the consuming component. However, if there is a consumer, messages send from the producer must be consumed synchronously in the same thread to preserve the transaction context of the producer. That why I chose direct for the producer's endpoint.


What is meant by ""the messages might be consumed"" is that the consuming component might not be deployed, when the consumer produces the first messages, or perhaps will never be deployed. I know there is the block option for the direct component but I don't want the producer to wait for the consumer as it might take some time (possibly forever) for the consumer to be available.


I think this is a very common scenario for a messaging system and I was surprised not to find an easy out-of-the-box way to handle this with camel. That's why I think an additional option failIfNoConsumers (similar to the option for the seda component) for the direct and direct-vm component would be very handy.","boday:1417123866:2014-11-28T05:31:06.212+0000:1417210477:2014-11-29T05:34:37.808+0000:[~dpr] - what should happen to the message that was sent...just throw it away?  a seda producer can create a blocking queue on demand to hold the message until a consumer comes along.  this doesn't work for direct however given the need to make a synchronous call...hence the block option, etc.



daniel@peger.de:1417135329:2014-11-28T08:42:09.521+0000:1501784154:2017-08-04T02:15:54.687+0000:[~boday] - Even if it sounds wrong in the first place, I actually would discard the messages.

In the scenario described above, it is a valid situation that there is no consumer for a direct endpoint. And what else would you want to do, if no one is interested in the messages an endpoint produces, but to discard the messages. You can't wait as you don't know, if there will ever be a consumer for the message and you probably would not want an Exception to be thrown as Exceptions are a very costly way for flow-control, if they occur on a regular basis in a ""normal"" application state. That is discarding the message is the best option you have. As this is may lead to message loss where endpoints without consumers are not a valid application state, this definitively should be an opt-in option!

    https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/299

    Update to Smack 4.0.4

    Remove Presence Packet listener in XmppConsumer. It never worked, since
    the processPacket() method does check if the given Packet is instanceof
    Message, so the filtered Presence Packets never got processed.
    
    XMPPError.getCode() is no more. Integer error codes have been deprecated
    from XMPP for a while. Use getType() instead.
    
    Use the connection packet reply timeout, instead of the global one in
    SmackConfiguration (where the method name was changed to
    SmackConfiguration.getDefaultPacketReplyTimeout()).
    
    Use JivePropertiesManager for Packet properties.
    
    Fixes CAMEL-7903

For test fixtures this could possibly be worked around by perhaps adding the test routes directly with Camel Context components.

after investigating the issue I found that because the body is null - the request is created with type DefaultHttpRequest and not DefaultFullHttpRequest which is created when there is a body


this causes the HttpObjectEncoder to stay in a wrong state after the request is sent, because of this code:

Let's say that my CamelJmsDestinationName has a value of message.export.custom. The actual routing does indeed work as expected, however when looking at the log, it states that the message was to the route as stated by the second when clause, message.export.itemlocation rather than
message.export.custom



INFO |  >>> (ExportMessageFromJmsRoute) choice --> 
activemq://queue:message.export.itemlocation <<< 




This can be VERY confusing when debugging your routes.","daniel.lindberg1@gmail.com:1412723957:2014-10-08T07:19:17.736+0000:1412723957:2014-10-08T07:19:17.736+0000:Sorry, there is nothing wrong here."

Unfortunately it seems impossible to force the Camel Restlet module to prepare a DELETE Restlet Request with no entity. In fact the class
org.apache.camel.component.restlet.DefaultRestletBinding in its method populateRestletRequestFromExchange always creates an entity. Instead it should set a null entity in case exchange.getIn().getBody() is null.","njiang:1412793632:2014-10-09T02:40:32.873+0000:1412793632:2014-10-09T02:40:32.873+0000:Applied the patch into camel master, camel-2.14.x, camel-2.13.x  and camel-2.12.x branches."

A new test verifies that the MINA buffer does not grow out of bounds.

Two more changes:
* I updated MINA to 2.0.8.
* The HL7MLLPEncoder now also accepts plain byte arrays (without re-converting them into a String and back into a byte array). This works better with marshal(hl7), which emits a byte array anyway.

The patch should work for both trunk and 2.14 branch.

I'm using netty-http both as the HTTP server and also as a HTTP client (my app is a proxy service) and the exception is being thrown after the HTTP client response is received.
Please guide me if the original POST request is what you need or the request that camel-netty4-http issues?

I've just tried to change my route to use ""to()"" instead of ""routingSlip()"" and everything is properly working.
I updated the title of the bug to be more specific with these findings.

I still could not figure how it is related but the same code worked properly with camel-netty-http.
Once I changed my code to be sync with a regular processor, everything got back to work.

As previously reported - the problem was indeed resolved when running the unit test with spring 4.0.7-RELEASE - but unfortunately when trying to run it ""live"" with tomcat server I still got the same exception.

I'm attaching a zip (""Reproduce2.zip"") that includes a jar that can be executed from command-line, and contains another zip with the sources.
When running the jar it will load the camel route using spring boot.
in order to simulate the issue you need to send any POST message to http://localhost:8080 on your machine after executing command line.

Thx,
Amit.

So either you need to convert the content to byte[] / string etc to not use netty's buffer anymore. Or we have to add some logic in NettyChannelBufferStreamCache to detect hand over the lifecycle of the buffer, or do a copy of the buffer (a copy will cause 2x memory usage)

when an imported XSD is decoded, Camel uses a converter defined in context. That converter involves a reader that will not take into account the XSD XML prolog. If that reader does not use the same encoding as one of the imported XSD, you may get into trouble while validating XML files.
Instead of providing the content of XSD as char stream, I think it is more appropriate to provide it as a binary stream and let Sax make a good guess about the XSD encoding.
I made a pull request on github with a unit test and a fix : see https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/291

An app, that consumes syslog entries and forwards JMS (over OpenMQ), was upgraded from camel 2.13.0 to 2.14.0.

Turns out that the CamelSyslogTimestamp header was silently discarded, being a java.util.GregorianCalendar instance.

This is due to org.apache.camel.model.rest.RestBindingDefinition.createProcessor(RouteContext) looking up and configuring the same DataFormat object twice:

http://camel.apache.org/custom-dataformat.html only mentions how to use custom data formats as a bean in the registry. I myself am not sure how this is going to work now that this validation has been added but is it worth adding the approach to documentation?

For example
{code}
  <restConfiguration component=""servlet"" bindingMode=""json"" contextPath=""/camel-example-servlet-rest-blueprint/rest""
                       port=""8181"">
      <dataFormatProperty key=""prettyPrint"" value=""true""/>
    </restConfiguration>
{code}

You can have as many dataFormatProperty you want. And you can prefix with json.in xml.in etc, as in the documentation to have different config.

The rest-dsl requires to instantiate and handle the lifecycle of the used data format, hence not intended to use an existing instance.

        } 
} 




With Camel, it's a bit less code, but if I don't override the ""base.path"", it defaults to localhost:8080. The Spring MVC Swagger implementation figures out the correct base path on its own. 



        /** 
         * Swagger Camel Configuration 
         */ 
        @Bean 
        public ServletRegistrationBean swaggerServlet() { 
                ServletRegistrationBean swagger = new ServletRegistrationBean(new SpringRestSwaggerApiDeclarationServlet(), ""/swagger/*""); 
                Map<String, String> params = new HashMap<>(); 
                params.put(""base.path"", ""https://localhost:8443/rest""); 
                params.put(""api.title"", propertyResolver.getProperty(""title"")); 
                params.put(""api.description"", propertyResolver.getProperty(""description"")); 
                params.put(""api.termsOfServiceUrl"", propertyResolver.getProperty(""termsOfServiceUrl"")); 
                params.put(""api.version"", propertyResolver.getProperty(""version"")); 
                params.put(""api.license"", propertyResolver.getProperty(""license"")); 
                params.put(""api.licenseUrl"", propertyResolver.getProperty(""licenseUrl"")); 
                swagger.setInitParameters(params); 
                return swagger; 
        } 




Is it possible to improve the SpringRestSwaggerApiDeclarationServlet so it gets the path from CamelServlet and it doesn't have to be hardcoded?

Some beans are only needed by a certain endpoint and it would make sense to set the bean up with the endpoint in routebuilder configure method.


If we added a reference to self in SimpleRegistry we could setup the Camel context by DefaultCamelContext(new SimpleRegistry()) or OsgiDefaultCamelContext(bundleContext, new SimpleRegistry()) and easily access the registry from the routebuilder with SimpleRegistry registry = (SimpleRegistry) getContext().lookupByName(SimpleRegistry.NAME);.


Then we can set up beans in routebuilder configure and simply add them with registry.put. And the same routebuilder could be used in plain Java, in OSGi or elsewhere.


All that is needed is this change in SimpleRegistry:



public static final String NAME;
static {
   NAME = java.util.UUID.randomUUID().tostring();
}

public SimpleRegistry() {
   put.(NAME, this);

Something like: getContext().getRegistry().add(""thisand"", ""that"");. But given the number of different registry combinations that is probably not very easy to implement in a clean fashion.

Of course there is the usual way of passing the registry reference to the routebuilders, but that is not very straightforward when working with org.apache.camel.main.Main.

How about just biting the bullet and adding a bind(String name, Object bean) method to the Registry interface and every implementation? Then the user wouldn't have to care which registry flavor CamelContext is using behind the scenes.

From a user standpoint if you want to put values into your registry you can use a {{SimpleRegistry}} and keep a reference on it. If you can't keep a reference you can add it into your registry
{code}
SimpleRegistry registry = new SimpleRegistry();
registry.put(""itself"", registry)

// Later on you can do
getContext().getRegistry().lookupByNameAndType(""itself"", SimpleRegistry.class).put(theKey, theValue)
{code}

At the same time I'm trying to keep my routebuilders portable so that they would run the same in org.apache.camel.main.Main and Karaf SCR bundle.

Your approach works fine in both as long as the CamelContext is created with a SimpleRegistry and the routebuilder knows the registry key (""itself"").

The change to SimpleRegistry up there in the original post is of course not possible because it would make the registry non-empty when it's instanciated, and that would be odd to many (including me). But the point was to guarantee that if routebuilder knows SimpleRegistry it would also know its key.

The best solution would be to have a method for adding stuff in the Registry interface. Is there a reason why Registry should be read-only?

    CAMEL-7875 Method for adding objects to Registry

    Having a write method in Registry interface simplifies configuring Camel routes in CamelTestSupport unit tests where a registry reference is not available and when you would like to configure beans required by the components inside route builder's configure method.
    
    This change eliminates the need to pass registry references around. If your code can see its CamelContext you'll have uniform write access to its registry.

For the ApplicationContextRegistry, BlueprintContainerRegistry, OSgiServiceRegistry and CdiBeanRegistry, we are not supposed to change them.

I think we can live with CompositeRegistry to add object and don't change the other Registry.

yuruki:1412991795:2014-10-11T09:43:15.103+0000:1412991795:2014-10-11T09:43:15.103+0000:Fair enough. If there are that many read-only Registry implementations we obviously can't add a write method to Registry interface.

The thought of easier write access to CamelContext's registry came to me when a component in a route required a bean in the registry (jetty securityHandler, restlet restletRealm and others). The go-to object in Camel is CamelContext and I was surprised to learn there is no method for adding beans there.

OK, I thought, I'll just create the CamelContext with a SimpleRegistry and pass it to the RouteBuilders. This worked fine until I noticed that CamelTestSupport doesn't offer a way to create the context with a SimpleRegistry. Well, I dropped CamelTestSupport and nowadays create the tests as plain JUnit4 tests.

Still, instead of making every framework around CamelContext (such as CamelTestSupport) flexible enough to suit everyone CamelContext could host its own SimpleRegistry by default which would offer write access and which would be included in the lookups (not unlike CompositeRegistry). Its usage could be something like:

{code}
context.getEmbeddedRegistry().put(""name"", bean);
{code}

What do you think?

A Camel registry will thus not offer that functionality, and make it inconsistent behavior when a bean is found from Camel vs the others.

Also if a bean by type / name is in both which one to choose, and return? (eg how to handle duplicates) etc.

If the use-case is to make it easier to register beans manually to override existing beans for unit testing, then its better to improve camel-test. And leave current as-is.

If the user doesn't use the embedded registry, everything works exactly as before.

If the user decided to put beans in the embedded registry they should know that the bean initializations are up to them, as it is for Simple and Jndi registries now. These beans will stay in their CamelContext's scope and won't cause problems elsewhere.

Pretty much the only visible change required for all of this is to provide access to a SimpleRegistry inside CamelContext with public getEmbeddedRegistry() method. Most of the remaining functionality already exists in [Osgi]DefaultCamelContext(new SimpleRegistry()) code path."
